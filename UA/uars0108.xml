<head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Established in November 1956, the Western Data Processing Center (WDPC) was the first university computing center specifically organized to encourage and support research and education in business management.</p>
<p>This mission was achieved by providing computing facilities, processing systems, and necessary services for the efficient computation of data processing problems in academic research projects and educational activities in any academic discipline especially business administration and management science. The center also assisted users in writing programs for the computer by providing education and consulting services.</p>
<p>This was a joint effort between the Regents of the University of California and International Business Machines (IBM). Later funding was provided by the Ford Foundation through the Western Management Sciences Institute and the Advanced Research Projects Agency, Department of Defense.</p>
<p>The WDPC was a division of the Graduate School of Business Administration on the Los Angeles campus of the University of California. Approval for the center was given by the Regents in November of 1956; official operations started in 1957 with facilities opening in 1958. WDPC closed in June, 1966, at the end of its 10-year contract with IBM.</p>
<p>The WDPC was not considered a teaching department, because it did not offer courses for academic credit. However, it did offer a series of non-credit courses on machine operation and programming.</p>
<p>Users of the center were limited to faculty and graduate students from participating accredited academic institutions (4-year institutions) in the western region.</p>
<p>The center's two directors were Dr. George W. Brown (1957-62) and Dr. R. Clay Sprowls (1965-66).</p>

<head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>Record Series 108 contains publications generated by the Western Data Processing Center (WDPC) under the auspices of the University of California, Los Angeles, Graduate School of Business. Files include announcements of events, Contributions to Scientific Research in Management, newsletters, and progress reports. Additionally, this record series features material from the Western Management Science Institute (WMSI), which used a grant from the Ford Foundation to partially fund WDPC in its later years. WMSI files include working papers and colloquium documents.</p>
<p>This is an inactive record series; no additional University records are expected to be added.</p>
