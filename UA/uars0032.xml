    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Classes in Geography were offered when the Los Angeles State Normal School opened its doors in 1882. In 1985, the Geography Department was formally established as an academic unit. Prior to 1919, when the Los Angeles State Normal School was incorporated into the University of the California system, the Geography Department was primarily concerned with the training of secondary school teachers. After 1920 more emphasis was placed on training of researcher and preparing students for graduate studies. Graduate courses leading to the Masters of Art degree were to the department curriculum in 1934-1935; and the Doctoral program was added in 1948-1949.</p>  </bioghist>
