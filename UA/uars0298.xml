<head>Historical Note</head>
<p>In 1939 the College of Business Administration at UCLA was authorize to institute a M.B.A. program and the first 27 graduate students in business entered the university. A doctoral program was initiated in 1953, and in 1955 the graduate program were used to form a graduate school of business separate from the undergraduate school. Special agencies were then added to the graduate school, among them the Western Data Processing Center (1956) and Western Management Science Institute (1960). In 1961 a master of science degree was added to the graduate school's curriculum and the school library was established. Before the end of the 1960s, the undergraduate school and its B.S. degree in Business Administration were phased out, leaving the Graduate School of Business Administration as the only source of business education on the UCLA campus. The present name of John E. Anderson Graduate School of Management was bestowed on the school in 1987.</p>
