<head>Historical Note</head>
<p>In 1939, the College of Business Administration at UCLA was authorized to institute a M.B.A. program and the first twenty-seven graduate students in business that entered the university. A doctoral program was initiated in 1953; and in the 1955, the graduate programs were to form a graduate school of business separate from the undergraduate school. Special agencies were then added to the graduate school, among them the Western Data Processing Center in 1956 and Western Management Science Institute in 1960. In 1961, a master of science degree was added to the graduate school's curriculum and school library was established. Before the end of the 1960s, the undergraduate and its B.S. degree in Business Administration were phased out, leaving the Graduate School of Business Administration as the only source of business education on the UCLA campus. The present name of the John E. Anderson Graduate School of Management was bestowed on the school 1987.</p>
