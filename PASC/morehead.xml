    <head>Biography</head>
<p>Howard Morehead was born in Topeka, Kansas in 1926. After graduating from high school, he enlisted in the Army Air Corps and was assigned to Tuskegee Army Airfield, where he began training as a pilot in anticipation of joining the pioneering Tuskegee Airmen. The war ended before he saw combat, and after his discharge from the military he moved to Los Angeles.</p><p>After earning a degree in photography from Los Angeles City College, he joined the staff of the <emph render="italic">Los Angeles Sentinel</emph> newspaper in 1950, and also freelanced for various magazines. Eventually he became the first West Coast staff photographer for Johnson Publishing Company, contributing stories and covers for <emph render="italic">Ebony</emph> and <emph render="italic">Jet</emph>. A fan of jazz music, Morehead photographed many of the important musicians of his time, as well as many actors and politicians.</p><p>His interest in glamour photography and his awareness of racial discrimination inspired him to found the Miss Bronze L.A. beauty contest in 1958, which soon expanded into the Miss Bronze California pageant, affording African American women the opportunity to compete. In 1970, Morehead became the first African American hired as a staff cameraman for a Los Angeles television station when he began working for KTLA. After a year, he moved to KABC, where he spent seventeen years as a cameraman before retiring.</p><p>Morehead continued to document the Los Angeles jazz scene throughout the 1990s. He died in July, 2003.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>The collection predominantly consists of photographs taken by Morehead, mostly of musicians and venues in Los Angeles from the mid-1950s through the 1990s. Subjects include Ray Charles, Miles Davis, Billie Holiday, and many others. There are also a number of actors and politicians represented, including Diahann Carroll, Redd Foxx, John F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Many of the most important photographs from Morehead's early career exist only as a single image. For instance, there is one photograph of Dexter Gordon that Morehead clearly favored and replicated numerous times in different contexts. But there is no negative of that photograph and no other images from the photo session.</p><p>There are, however, voluminous examples of glamour photography, with thousands of negatives of would-be models and actresses posing in attitudes ranging from chaste portraiture to provocative nudity. Many of these photographs were related to the beauty contests organized by Morehead.</p><p>The collection also includes some personal and business papers, as well as books, videotapes, and sound recordings from his personal collection. Of particular interest in the papers is Morehead's correspondence with <emph render="italic">Playboy</emph>, which repeatedly rebuffed his attempts to sell photographs of women of color to the magazine. Also noteworthy are documents pertaining to Morehead's employment at KABC-TV, where he was reprimanded numerous times over the years, eventually prompting him to file a racial-discrimination lawsuit.</p>  </scopecontent>
