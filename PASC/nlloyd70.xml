<p>Norman Lloyd was born in 1914 in New Jersey. After graduating from NYU, he worked with Eva LeGalleine's Repertory group. In 1937, along with Orson Welles and John Houseman, Lloyd founded The Mercury Theater. During the ensuing years he appeared in dozens of plays on Broadway and throughout the US. Between 1942 and 1952 he acted in several films, but was best known for his film debut in the Alfred Hitchcock film, Saboteur (1942).
