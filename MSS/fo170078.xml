    <head>Biography</head>
<p>Born in 1815, in Liverpool, England, John Forster grew up to become one of the largest landowners in all of California. At the age of 17, Forster was working for his uncle, James Johnson, in Guaymas, Mexico. He became the captain of one of his uncle's ships, and in 1836, became a Mexican citizen. Forster moved to Los Angeles, where he worked as a shipping agent at San Pedro. He was also Captain of the Port of San Pedro. In 1837 he married Dona Ysidora Pico, sister of Pio Pico, governor of California.</p><p>Forster began acquiring land in the 1840s. Governor Pico granted him the lands of Rancho Trabuco and Rancho Mission Viejo, in addition to his holdings of Rancho San Felipe and Rancho de la Nacion, in what is now San Diego County. In 1844 Forster purchased the old Mission San Juan Capistrano for $710, where he made his home until Mission was given back to the Catholic Church in 1864.</p><p>In 1846 the United States and Mexico were at war, and Governor Pico fled to Mexico, leaving Forster in charge of Pico's rancho, Santa Margarita y las Flores (the area which is now Camp Pendleton). On his return to California, Pico borrowed large sums of money from Forster to cover his gambling debts. In 1864 Forster offered to pay $14,000 and assume all of Pico's debts, in return for the deed to Rancho Santa Margarita y las Flores. The Picos agreed and Forster became the largest landowner in California, eventually holding over 200,000 acres. Forster's capital was drained through subsequent efforts to fence his estates, attract settlers, and maintain his livestock through a severe drought. When Forster died in 1882, his estate was in shambles, and his sons were forced to sell the properties.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>At the end of the 19th century, Hubert Bancroft and his close associates engaged in an oral history project to record the experiences of Californios who had inhabited California prior to the American annexation. As part of this project, Thomas Savage interviewed John Forster at his home in San Juan Capistrano in early 1878. After an explanatory note by Savage, Forster's dictation begins with a short description of his early life in England and Mexico. He then describes the political scene in Los Angeles in the 1830s, and the activities of contemporaries such as Manuel Micheltorena, Pio Pico, Juan Bautista Alvarado, Jose Castro, and Carlos Antonio Carrillo. Then, the content shifts almost entirely to the skirmishes between American and Mexican forces during the Mexican War, 1846-1848. Forster describes the battles of Los Angeles, San Diego, San Pascual, Rancho Dominguez, and Chino. The interview ends abruptly with the Treaty of Cahuenga and the surrender of Pio Pico.</p>  </scopecontent>
