    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Linda Farin was a successful lawyer in Austin, Texas. After seeing Donna Deitch's film <title render="italic">Desert Hearts</title>, she became inspired and challenged to produce a realistic and positive lesbian erotic film and began forming a cohort of lesbian writers in order to develop a script. Through her participation with Liatris Media, which produced the Third Wave Women's International Film and Video Festival from 1986-1989, Linda Farin met Greta Schiller and Andrea Weiss. Greta Schiller became involved in the project in the early stages anonymously and later added her name to the project as Director. Farin formed both Foosh Productions and Anonymous Was a Woman Ltd. in order to help fund the project. Anonymous Was A Woman Ltd. was later dissolved in 1996.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>The Linda Farin Papers document the conception, production, distribution, and reception of the film <title render="italic">Waking Up: A Lesson in Love</title>, produced and co-written by Linda Farin. These papers include script drafts, financial documents, advertising strategies, copy reviews and correspondence.</p><p>Throughout the production of the film, funding issues as well as philosophical challenges arose from both within the circle of people working on the film as well as from the outside. In her story "The Making of a Lesbian Erotic Video" (contained within the collection), Lindsey Lane (co-writer and co-producer) outlines some of her frustrations with the effects of both homophobia and the difficulties of producing independent films. Much of the correspondence between reviewers and distributors reflects some of this conflict as well. While <title render="italic">Waking Up: A Lesson in Love</title> was produced in the late 1980's, the tensions of the "sex wars" of the late seventies and early eighties are present in the collection. Many of the reviewers and distributors approached by Linda Farin were generally uncomfortable with the portrayal of lesbian casual sex in the film in contrast to some of the more sex positive publications which chose to advertise and review the film such as <title render="italic">On Our Backs</title> magazine or <title render="italic">Forum</title>.</p>  </scopecontent>
