    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>John Dougherty was one of the earliest students of Ted Shawn in the 1920s. He left the dance world in the 1930s and returned to it in 1955 as the Southern California Reporter for Dance Magazine, a post he kept for ten years. He is well known for his many articles in that journal as well as in Dance News. In the 1960s, he took on the position of private secretary for Ruth St. Denis, a position he kept until her death in 1968. He transcribed hundreds of her letters, speeches and articles, many of which are important in the history of dance. In addition to this post, Dougherty established an intimate friendship with Ted Shawn which he maintained by way of voluminous correspondence and visits until Shawn's death in December, 1971. The letters are detailed about Shawn's life and his involvement in dance, and the Dougherty letters provide valuable information about Ruth St. Denis and her foundation in Los Angeles, for which Dougherty was the corresponding secretary. John Dougherty died in Los Angeles in April, 1988.</p>  </bioghist>
