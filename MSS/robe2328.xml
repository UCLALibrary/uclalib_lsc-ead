    <abstract id="aspace_b6f22581d7012014a724a85259ba6b57" label="Abstract">In 1965, L. G. Roberts (Lawrence G.) successfully implemented the first computer-to-computer packet link between MIT and Systems Development Corporation (SDC). In 1966, Roberts became the chief scientist and in 1967 the director of the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), later renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the United States Department of Defense (DoD). As director, Roberts was responsible for designing and managing the implementation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) computer communications network, a research packet switching computer communications network that was the precursor to the internet. 

The collection contains the professional and research files of L. G. Roberts dating from 1962 to 2009 and includes publications; notes written by Roberts concerning the development of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET); notes on the internet and on networked computing more broadly; professional correspondence.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
<p>L. G. Roberts (Lawrence G.) was born in Connecticut in 1937, the son of Elliott and Elizabeth Roberts. After graduating with his BS (1959), MS (1960), and PhD (1963) in Electrical Engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Roberts began work at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory, where he carried out research on computer networks. In 1965, Roberts successfully implemented the first computer-to-computer packet link between MIT and Systems Development Corporation (SDC). </p><p>In 1966, Roberts became the chief scientist and in 1967 the director of the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), later renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the United States Department of Defense (DoD). As director, Roberts was responsible for designing and managing the implementation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) computer communications network, a research packet switching computer communications network that was the precursor to the internet. </p><p>In 1973, Roberts left IPTO to form the first commercial packet network, Telenet, where he held the position of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) until his departure in 1980. Starting in 1983, Roberts served as CEO of NetExpress and of Netmax Communications, president of ATM Systems, and founded Caspian Networks and Anagran Inc. while continuing his work with network technology. For the development of computer packet switching and network technology, Roberts received many honors and awards including the Charles Stark Draper prize (2001) and Secretary of Defense Meritorious Service Medal (1973).</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
<p>This collection documents the professional and research life of L. G. (Lawrence G.) Roberts who was the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) program manager responsible for designing and managing the implementation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The materials represent Robert's activities during the early period of development (1966-1973) of the packet computer network, ARPANET, started by the Department of Defense. The collection includes original data rate charts, logical and geographic maps, presentation slides, reports, conference itineraries, trade and scholarly publications, and correspondence relating to the cost, efficiency, research and development of the ARPANET. Materials dated later than 1973 consist primarily of special interest and trade publications which document the accomplishments of Roberts, the development of the ARPANET, and early computer networking history.</p>  </scopecontent>
