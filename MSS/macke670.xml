He won the Nobel Prize for literature (1925) for his work which is marked by both idealism and humanity, its stimulating satire often being infused with a singular poetic beauty... He was also known as an advocate of social reform. The collection consists of manuscripts, correspondence, pamphlets, ephemera, and art objects by, or relating to, George Bernard Shaw.</abstract>
