    <head>Biography</head>
<p>Alice Greenfield McGrath (April 5, 1917-November 27, 2009) was a political activist who first became known for her work to overturn the improper convictions of Mexican American youth in Sleepy Lagoon Trial in which the defendants were tried as a group under inhumane conditions. McGrath also supported humanitarian efforts and revolution in Nicaragua, pro bono work through the Mexican American Bar Association, and taught courses on self defense. </p><p>Alice Greenfield McGrath was born in Calgary, Canada to a family of Russian Jewish immigrants. At the age of 5, McGrath and her family moved to Los Angeles. McGrath's experience growing up as an immigrant heavily influenced her later involvement in social activism. After graduating high school, McGrath worked several jobs including working in a candy factory and as a sales representative for Grove Press. </p><p>At the age of 24, Alice McGrath began volunteering for the defense committee of the Sleepy Lagoon Trial, now widely known for unjustly convicting an entire group of young Mexican-American youth with little evidence and many human rights violations. Several months later, she was appointed executive secretary. Though she was not directly involved in the legal work on the case, she worked tirelessly to raise awareness about the trial, coordinate efforts. Of particular note is McGrath's effort to correspond with and visit the defendants in prison. In October 1944 the committee's work paid off, and Judge Clement Nye overturned the convictions. The case then became a foundation for legal decisions nationwide concerning defendants' rights. </p><p>Alice Greenfield McGrath's direct involvement in the case led playwright Luis Valdez to contact her and buy the rights to her character. In l978, Zoot Suit, a play by Luis Valdez based on the sleepy lagoon case and the servicemen riots premiered at the Mark Taper Forum with much acclaimed success. The play is a fictionalized account of the trial. Alice McGrath becomes the central character. A film rendition of the play makes headlines in the l980s. </p><p>In 1952, she married Thomas McGrath, a poet and teacher. During this time, both came under surveillance by the FBI for their political ideologies and community activism. This investigation led to Thomas McGrath being summoned to appear before the Un-American Activities Committee. </p><p>Around 1957, Alice McGrath met Bruce Tegner, her son Daniel's self-defense instructor. Based on her son's experience, McGrath enrolled in Tegner's courses, earned various titles, and began working with Tegner to write books on self-defense. She later taught self-defense courses at various community centers and colleges around Southern California. </p><p>In addition to her career, McGrath continued to volunteer her time toward political and humanitarian efforts. She made numerous trips to Nicaragua during and after the Sandinista National Liberation Front overthrow of the Somoza government. She led clergy, physicians, lawyers, and teachers on tours through the country and helped raise money to buy medicine for Nicaraguan hospitals and Hurricane Mitch victims, her humanitarian work also continued in the United States, where she became the coordinator of the Pro Bono department of the Mexican American Bar Association. </p><p>Alice McGrath died on November 27, 2009 at the age of 92 from complications of a chronic illness. </p>  </bioghist>
