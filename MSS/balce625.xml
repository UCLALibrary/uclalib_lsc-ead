    <head>Biography</head>
<p>Antony Galindo Balcena, a Mexican-American, was born in Lompoc, California on April 30, 1954. Antony Balcena, (also known as Tony Balcena) was an accomplished dancer, choreagrapher and Gay and AIDS activist.</p><p>Balcena started taking dance classes at the Riverside Ballet Arts Theater, Riverside, California, in the early 1970s. In 1974 he decided to audition at the Juilliard School of Dancing and was accepted, and later earned his B.F.A. in 1977. He continued his studies and got a M.A. in Dance from UCLA in 1984 and a M.F.A. in Dance from Arizona State University in 1992. </p><p>Balcena began his dancing and choreographic career in New York City where he worked on and off Broadway. Balcena dancing style was influenced by the work of Daniel Lewis, who taught him the Limon technique. He worked with Daniel Lewis Dance Repertory Company from 1975 to 1981. Balcena's career covered dancing and bodybuilding. He worked as a professional bodybuilding coach for many years. From 1983 to 1990, he staged and choreographed several bodybuilding competitions (Mr. Olympia, Ms. Olympia, Mr. America and Mr. Universe). </p><p>In the 1980s, Balcena returned to Los Angeles where he worked with Sarah Elgart and Co. (1982) as a dancer and eventually became Assistant Director. In 1989 and 1990 he participated in the Los Angeles Dance Kaleidoscope presenting several dancing productions (e.g. "Dudes"). During the 1990s he also choreographed several controversial works about AIDS (e.g. "Shell of Flesh," "AIDS! The Musical"). He also worked as assistant choreographer for films such as "Earth Girls Are Easy" and "Rented Lips." </p><p>Balcena received several awards and honors during his career. In 1991, he won a choreographic award from the Nuevo L.A. Chicano Danceworks Festival, and an Award of Merit from the Juilliard School Alumni Association's Los Angeles chapter. He also worked for several years (1983-1993) as an instructor at Loyola Marymount University, Cal State University San Bernardino, and Plaza de La Raza, a Mexican cultural arts center. In 1994, he joined the Dance faculty at Arizona State University. He died on November 23, 1995 of complications resulting from AIDS.</p><p>Sources:
