      <head>Processing Information</head>
      <p>Collections are processed to a variety of levels depending on the work necessary to make
        them usable, their perceived user interest and research value, availability of staff and
        resources, and competing priorities. Library Special Collections provides a standard level
        of preservation and access for all collections and, when time and resources permit, conducts
        more intensive processing. These materials have been arranged and described according to
        national and local standards and best practices.</p>
