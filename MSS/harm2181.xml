    <head>Biography/History</head>
<p>The Har-ma Press was invented in the late 1970s by Harold Smith, an engineer from Sacramento, California. The name of the press is derived from the first three letters of Harold Smith's first name and the last two letters of his wife, Alma's first name. Harold and Alma Smith worked closely as authors and printers. </p><p>In 1978, the Har-ma caught the eye of Roger Levenson, printer and proprietor of Tamalpais Press, during a demonstration by Smith at a printer's fair. Levenson immediately ordered one for himself, and Smith subsequently consulted Levenson on design improvements as he built additional presses. Levenson also recommended the Har-ma to Muir Dawson, owner and operator of Dawson's Bookshop in Los Angeles. Dawson purchased a  Har-ma press for the bookshop, and arranged the sale of several others, including one to UCLA. Smith built a total of 15 presses: a prototype numbered 0 and numbers 1-16, but no number 13. Harold Smith died in 1999.</p>  </bioghist>
