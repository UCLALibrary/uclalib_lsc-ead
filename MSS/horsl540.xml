    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>William and David Horsley were pioneers in the motion-picture industry, starting in Bayonne, New Jersey, in 1907, under the name of Centaur Film Company (later Nestor Motion Picture Company). For the first three years, William was a silent partner, financing the little company which brother David was running. But from 1910 until 1916 he played an active role in the company running the laboratory part of the business. In 1916 he withdrew from the company and set up the Bill Horsley Laboratory, later known as Hollywood Film Enterprises, Inc., devoted exclusively to the developing and printing of 35mm. films.</p><p>He and his brother, along with other independents (notably Carl Laemmle and his Independent Motion Picture Company, known as IMPS, Swanson and Ed Porter) founded Universal Picture Company in 1912, and succeeded in defeating the monopolistic hold on the industry of the Patents Company and General Film Company (the famous Latham Loop controversy).</p>  </bioghist>
