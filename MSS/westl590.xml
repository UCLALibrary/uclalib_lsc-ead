    <head>Biography/History</head>
<p>Louis Jolyon (Jolly) West, M.D. (1924-1999) was a well-known Los Angeles psychiatrist who served as the chair of UCLA's Department of Psychiatry and as director of the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute from 1969 to1989. He was an expert on cults, coercive persuasion ("brainwashing"), alcoholism, drug abuse, violence, and terrorism. He served as an expert witness in the trial of Patricia "Patty" Hearst, and examined Jack Ruby, the murderer of JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald.</p><p>Dr. West was born in New York City on October 6, 1924 and grew up in Madison, WI. After a year of college, he enlisted in the U.S. Army hoping to serve combat duty in World War II, but was instead sent to the State University of Iowa for Army Specialized Training in medicine. He met his wife, Kathryn "K" Louise Hopkirk in Iowa, and the two married on April 29, 1944. Together they had three children, Anne Kathryn, Mary Elizabeth, and John Stuart.</p><p>Dr. West continued his studies at the University Of Minnesota School Of Medicine, and received his M.D. in 1949. He completed his psychiatric residency at the Payne Whitney Clinic of the New York Hospital (Cornell Medical Center) in 1952. </p><p>Dr. West served Lieutenant to Major in the U.S. Air Force from 1948 to 1956, and after completing his residency at Payne Whitney, he became the Chief of Psychiatric Service at the 3700th USAF Hospital at the Lackland Air Force Base. At Lackland he worked with returning POWs from the Korean War who had falsely confessed to germ warfare. His experiences with these men sparked a lifelong interest in helping victims of imprisonment, torture, and coercive persuasion ("brainwashing"). He also helped develop a highly successful method of alcoholism treatment dubbed "The Lackland Model," and he took a humanitarian approach to understanding homosexuality in the military. </p><p>In 1954, at only 29, Dr. West was appointed professor and chair of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Oklahoma, being "perhaps the youngest full professor in an American medical school." In Oklahoma City he demonstrated his support of the civil rights movement by attending sit-ins and rallies, and bringing along his friend, actor Charlton Heston, to aid in the publicity of such events.</p><p>Dr. West's research interests continually expanded, always incorporating the changes taking place in society. During a 1962 study on the effects of LSD on a bull elephant, Dr. West and his colleagues accidently killed the elephant by administering too high of a dosage of either LSD or a tranquilizer. This incident was often brought up by his adversaries when they attempted to portray him as irresponsible and as a "crack pot." In 1967, he led a group of researchers to San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district where they rented an apartment and studied the hippie culture, particularly as it related to sex and drugs. </p><p>In 1969, Dr. West seized the opportunity to move to Los Angeles and become the chair of UCLA's Department of Psychiatry and director of the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute. In terms of his research interests, Dr. West felt that a rapidly expanding and diverse city like Los Angeles was most appropriate. Shortly after arriving at UCLA, he set out to create a "Center for the Study and Reduction in Violence," "the world's first and only center for the study of interpersonal violence." His plans for the Center were never actually realized because there was "such an outcry against it?based on arguments that to study violence was essentially to experiment on underprivileged people,?, doing brain operations, putting electrodes in their heads, or making guinea pigs out of them… This was the most frustrating experience of my career." </p><p>Dr. West's career included many remarkable events, including his participation in the highly-publicized 1976 trial of newspaper heiress Patricia "Patty" Hearst. Dr. West, an expert on coercive persuasion, testified for the defense that Ms. Hearst was not in her right mind when she participated in the bank robbery with the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA). In 1977, he traveled to South Africa to testify on behalf of a group of Zulus who had been forced, through torture and other inhumane tactics, to confess to crimes they did not commit. He returned to South Africa in 1983 and 1984 to testify on behalf of a political prisoner suffering from post-traumatic stress.</p><p>Throughout his career Dr. West was interviewed for newspaper articles and television reports on a variety of topics including cults, coercive persuasion, violence, alcoholism and drug abuse, kidnapping and terrorism. He received many honors including a 1959 nomination as one of the "Ten Most Outstanding Young Men in America," the 1973 Benjamin Rush Gold Medal Award from the American Psychiatric Association, a dedication--the "Louis Jolyon West House" treatment facility at the Oklahoma Center for Alcohol-Related Studies, the 1987 Vestermark Award from the American Psychiatric Association and the National Institute of Mental Health, the 1989 Leo J. Ryan Award from the National Cult Awareness Network, and in 1990 an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from the Hebrew Union College. </p><p>West retired from his positions as chair and director in 1989, but continued as a professor in the Psychiatry department, and continued to write articles and present papers at conferences around the world. West passed away on January 2, 1999 at the age of 74. In 2009, his son, John Stuart West published a memoir about being asked to assist in the suicides of each of his parents, Jolly and K. </p><p><emph render="super">1</emph> Dean of Oklahoma medical school <lb/><emph render="super">2</emph> West quoted in the <emph render="italic">Los Angeles Times,</emph> 1985 <lb/><emph render="super">3</emph> Ibid. </p>  </bioghist>
