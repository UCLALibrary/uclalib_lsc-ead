    <head>Biographical History</head>
<p>Paul Julius Alexander was born in Berlin, Germany in 1910. He earned law degrees in Hamburg in 1932 and Paris in 1934. In 1935 he moved to the United States and in 1940 earned his Ph.D. in ancient and Byzantine history from Harvard. His first teaching post was at Hobart College in 1945, and from there he moved to Brandeis University in 1954, Michigan in 1958, and then Berkeley in 1968 as professor of History and of Comparative Literature. Numerous awards included Guggenheim Fellowships in 1951 and 1965, membership in the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton in 1951 and 1970, and a Senior Fellowship of the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1974. One of the world's leading Byzantinists, he was well grounded in the classics, learned Syriac, Arabic, Old Church Slavonic and Russian, and also worked on secular biography, patristics, iconoclasm and codicology. His major work (and first book) was The Patriarch Nicephorus of Constantinople: Ecclesiastical Policy and Image Worship in the Byzantine Empire (Oxford, 1958); which was recognized as the standard monograph on the later iconoclastic period (815-843A.D.). He died in 1977.</p>  </bioghist>
