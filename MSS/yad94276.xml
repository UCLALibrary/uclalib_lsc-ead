    <head>Biography/History</head>
<p>Jean Pascal Sébah was trained in photography as a young boy of sixteen by his brother Cosimi, following the death of their Syrian-born father, Pascal Sébah in 1886. Jean took over the studio in 1888, and entered into partnership with a Frenchman, Polycarpe Joaillier; the studio became known as Sébah &amp; Joaillier. Based in Constantinople, they were the official photographers of the Sultan. According to the Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography, edited by John Hannavy, Sébah and Joaillier came to be the chief "suppliers of evocative imagery to the increasing number of people who undertook the Victorian Grand Tour" (see v. I, p. 1730-1734). Sébah &amp; Joaillier continued in business until 1910 when Joaillier returned to France.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>In addition to the popular interior and exterior views of Saint Sophia mosque, the Sultan's mosque, and the Hippodrome, there are photographs of the Galata Tower, the ferry docks in the Eminönü district on the south side of the Golden Horn, and street scenes in the Scutari district on the Anatolian shore of the Bosphorus. Street scenes include merchants peering from their storefronts, a group of Turkish men in their native dress drinking small cups of coffee and smoking water pipes or hookahs, and an old date merchant, a huge wicker basked strapped to his back, holding a scale used to weigh out his dates. Two of the photographs feature a local cemetery and tall ornately engraved tombstones.</p>  </scopecontent>
