    <abstract id="aspace_7596fdbc65e1c810eeb12e56be8fa5c2">William Marcel "Buddy" Collette (1921-2010) was an American jazz musician, composer, and educator who performed on flute, saxophone, and clarinet and was active primarily in Los Angeles. A founding member of the Chico Hamilton Quintet, Collette began his musical career in high school and further developed his professional practice during his service as a band leader in the U.S. Navy during World War II. The collection spans approximately the 1940s through the early 2000s and documents Collette's professional career and creative output. Materials include correspondence and personal papers; musical works in manuscript and published formats; writings and other creative materials; printed and ephemeral materials; photographs; and audiovisual and born-digital materials. Audiovisual and digital materials document studio and live performances, film and television work, interviews, instructional recordings, and educational and community activities. The collection documents Collette's contributions to jazz performance, composition, and music education, as well as his professional networks within the Los Angeles music community.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>William Marcel "Buddy" Collette (1921-2010) was an American jazz musician, composer, arranger, educator, and labor activist based in Los Angeles. Born and raised in the Watts neighborhood, Collette began performing professionally at fifteen while still in high school and was part of a close-knit community of musicians that included Charles Mingus and the Woodman brothers. He developed early proficiency on the saxophone, clarinet, and flute. During World War II, Collette served in the United States Navy as a bandsman and bandleader, developing his skills as a composer and arranger as they often needed new material to play. Following his discharge in 1945, he became an active participant in the postwar Los Angeles jazz scene, performing with prominent big bands and small ensembles and establishing himself as a studio musician.In 1949, Collette became the first Black musician hired to perform in a nationally broadcast television studio orchestra, appearing on You Bet Your Life. He later gained national recognition as a founding member of the Chico Hamilton Quintet, one of the most prominent West Coast jazz ensembles of the 1950s. In addition to leading his own groups, Collette collaborated extensively with musicians across jazz, popular music, film, and television.</p><p>Collette additionally played a significant role in the desegregation of the Los Angeles musicians' union, bringing together Local 47, a union for white musicians, and Local 767, a union for Black musicians in 1953. He was also deeply committed to music education, teaching at multiple Southern California institutions and mentoring younger musicians throughout his career. Collette's professional performing career ended in 1998 after a stroke. However, he continued to compose music for JazzAmerica, a band of teen jazz musicians he co-founded. Collette's career and accomplishments were rewarded with the Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Federation of Musicians and a special commendation from the Los Angeles Jazz Society, along with the legacy of the JazzAmerica program. He passed away in Los Angeles in 2010 at the age of 89. </p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection is comprised of personal and professional papers; contracts and business records; musical manuscripts and songbooks; writings; printed ephemera; photographs; and audiovisual and digital media accumulated and maintained by jazz multi-instrumentalist, composer, and educator Buddy Collette. It contains correspondence documenting Collette's personal relationships, collaborations, and professional networks, as well as administrative materials, including American Federation of Musicians contracts, personal agreements, copyright registration files, and financial records. The largest portion of the collection consists of musical works in manuscript form, including original compositions by Collette, arrangements by Collette of works by other composers, and scores and parts by other composers that were retained for performance, study, or reference. These materials appear primarily as manuscript scores, lead sheets, sketches, parts, and incomplete drafts, and include a substantial body of untitled and unidentified pages preserved and organized for access.</p><p>The collection also includes creative reference writings, such as poetry sent to Collette by friends and associates, scripts and dramatic texts, and discography-related notes, reflecting Collette's artistic community and interests beyond performance. Printed and ephemeral materials document Collette's public presence through reviews and newspaper clippings, concert and event programs, flyers, posters, and a small set of magazines and publications related to jazz culture and professional affiliations. Photographs, many originally stored in labeled binders, depict Collette with fellow musicians and friends, as well as materials related to his service in the U.S. Navy Reserve band at St. Mary's Pre-Flight School during World War II, alongside unidentified subjects. Audio, audiovisual and digital materials, including reel-to-reel tapes, audio and video cassettes, and CDs, DVDs, and DATs, document studio and master recordings, film and commercial music work, live performances, rehearsals, interviews, educational sessions, and community events, and preserve original labeling that has been transcribed without standardization. </p><p>It is important to note that the collection does not document every project, performance, or period of Collette's career in equal depth, and some musical and audiovisual materials lack dates, complete titles, or clear contextual information. In addition, while some materials originated in binders and labeled groupings, select binders were disassembled for preservation; original labels and identifiable groupings were retained where possible.</p>  </scopecontent>
