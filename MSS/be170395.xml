    <head>Biography</head>
<p>Raphael Fabian Bennett was born March 21, 1895 in Portland Oregon. He spent his youth in San Francisco, became an actor, and moved to Los Angeles. His mother was a drama critic and writer, and her work kept him closely connected with members of the acting profession. He began his career as a stunt man and then moved into Westerns, working in a total of 83 films. He was most famous for his role as a crooked lawyer in "Heaven Only Knows" and as Johnson in "Canyon City." He later worked as a director and producer. He died at the age of 62 of a heart attack.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>The novel takes place at the end of Benito Juarez's presidency, around 1871. The main character, Emilio Berceda, is known as the Militant Priest and a strong supporter of Benito Juarez's liberal reforms. Berceda kills a rival politician, who is also the father of a romantic rival. Porfirio Diaz's forces pursue Berceda through various affairs and escapades. After Juarez's death in 1871, Sebastian Lerdo de Tejada assumes the presidency, and continues to push for the capture of Berceda. The hero is ultimately betrayed by members of his circle, and succumbs to Diaz's men in the final scene. Although Berceda comes close to escaping to the United States, he dies.</p>  </scopecontent>
