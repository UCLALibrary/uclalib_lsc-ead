<head>Biography</head>
<p>The 1884 exposition in New Orleans was deemed a commercial failure and thus, seeking a way to recoup losses, the Board of State and Territorial Commissioners of the North, Central, and South American Exposition was formed on November 10th, 1885. The Board purchased the buildings from the original fair and attempted to re-open the exposition as a way to highlight New Orleans and the United States as a nexus of trade between the Americas. The second exposition also proved to be a financial failure, and it was disbanded as an organization on May 17th, 1886. All the buildings, except Horticultural Hall, were dismantled, and the site was developed into Audubon Park in the 1890s.</p>

<head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>The minutes for the North, Central, and South American Exposition document the efforts of the Board of State and Territorial Commissioners to make the second New Orleans exposition a success. Among other activities, the Commissioners sought to secure inexpensive public transit, display the newest commercial goods, and promote advertising that would attract people to the fair. The minutes document the work of the executive committee, finance committee, reception committee, printing committee, excursion committee, and committee on ceremonies. The record includes roll calls for commissioners, reports on railroad prices from various cities in the United States and its territories, discussions about the costs of printing and advertising, and lists of awards that would be presented at the exposition.</p>
