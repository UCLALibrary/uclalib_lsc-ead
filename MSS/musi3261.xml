    <head>Custodial History</head>
<p>Mr. Joel Pritkin joined the staff of The Music Center Operating Company on September 8, 1970 as the Archivist for the Music Center. He was responsible for collecting, evaluating, systematizing, preserving, and making available for reference Music Center public records and documents of historical significance. Prior to Pritkin's arrival, Kenn Randall and Norman Macdonald, two of the Music Center's House Managers initiated the archives out of two small storage rooms in the Ahmanson Theatre. Randall and Macdonald undertook to collect  historical items from the previous five years of the Center's existence. Because up until that time there was no plan to systematically retain these things, many were lost or scattered throughout the offices and even outside of the Music Center complex. Music Center chief administrator Bill Severns arranged for the purchase of the Raymond F. Barnes collection through the estate. This collection forms a nucleus of reference books and biographies, as well as historical items (mainly programs) covering much of the past of the Music Center and its Resident Groups, along with a wide selection of other theatres around the world. Shortly after Pritkin's hire, the Archives office was relocated to two rooms in the Ahmanson Annex where Pritkin was joined by Archives assistants James Davis and Larry Phillips. Pritkin's role as curator of the Music Center Archives continued until the arrival of Archivist Molly Paradiso circa 1990. Paradiso was joined by Julio Cesar Gonzalez circa 1993. Gonzalez worked as the Music Center Archivist for over two decades until his retirement on September 1, 2017. </p><p>Sources:

<p>The Music Center of Los Angeles County, a seven-acre performing arts complex in downtown Los Angeles, opened when the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion raised its curtain for the first time on December 6, 1964. The Ahmanson Theatre and Mark Taper Forum followed in April 1967. The complex expanded to eleven acres on October 24, 2003, when the Walt Disney Concert Hall opened, which includes the Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theater and the W.M. Keck Foundation Children's Amphitheatre. </p><p>Proposals for a performing arts center in Los Angeles had produced years of unsuccessful discussion and compromise between private citizens, County government, and downtown business organizations. The Music Center's story began with the Southern California Symphony Association's search for a permanent home for the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra.</p><p>In 1955, the Board of Supervisors appointed Dorothy Chandler, wife of <title>Los Angeles Times</title> publisher Norman Chandler, as chairperson of a civic committee to promote a performing arts facility for the County of Los Angeles. After many years of negotiation, a County site was designated in downtown's Bunker Hill district with 34.5 million dollars needed for construction. With Dorothy Chandler leading the drive, the Music Center Building Fund of the Southern California Symphony Association was established. Operating out of her home with the help of hundreds of volunteers, 20 million dollars was raised by donations from the business community and private citizens. </p><p>A contract between the County and The Music Center Lease Company was then established to build the facility on County-owned property. The remaining balance of 14.5 million dollars was raised by creating a land leaseback arrangement using mortgage revenue bonds.</p><p>The Music Center Operating Company (MCOC) was formed in 1961 to oversee the construction and to manage the Music Center complex. The MCOC handled the administration and operation of the Center. Its responsibilities ranged from management of theatre, stage, and box office operations; supervision of a restaurant and concessions; and providing the information center for the complex. The MCOC licensed the use of the three theatres to both long- and short term-tenants. Long-term producing organizations, also known as resident companies, had the first choice of the available time in the theatres. The resident companies included the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, the Center Theatre Group, the Los Angeles Opera, the Joffrey Ballet, and the Master Chorale.</p><p>Source: The Music Center of Los Angeles County History and Description document, Box 402, Folder 11, Music Center records (Collection 3261).

For 15 years, Clark was the sole guarantor for the Orchestra, but the non-profit Southern California Symphony Association was organized shortly before his death in 1934 to assure continued sponsorship of the Orchestra. The Philharmonic was largely responsible for the "Symphonies Under the Stars" at the Hollywood Bowl. In 1921, the Orchestra played a program for an Easter Sunrise Service at the Bowl. A similar program in 1922 led to the founding of the summer symphony concerts, which began in July of 1922 and established the Hollywood Bowl as the summer home for the Philharmonic. The Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra performed its winter season concerts at the Philharmonic Auditorium from 1920 through the end of the 1963/1964 season. In 1964, the Orchestra moved to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion where it performed until 2003, when it moved to the Walt Disney Concert Hall. After the 1927 departure of its first Music Director, Walter Henry Rothwell, ten conductors have served in that capacity: Georg Schnéevoigt (1927–1929), Artur Rodziński (1929–1933), Otto Klemperer (1933–1939), Alfred Wallenstein (1943–1956), Eduard van Beinum (1956–1959), Zubin Mehta (1962–1978), Carlo Maria Giulini (1978–1984), André Previn (1985–1989), Esa-Pekka Salonen (1992–2009), and Gustavo Dudamel (2009–present).</p><p>Source: Los Angeles Philharmonic Fact Sheet and History of the Los Angeles Philharmonic documents, Box 1,084, Music Center records (Collection 3261).

The Bowl's founders wished to establish an outdoor park and art center to entertain and educate a large audience and build community spirit in the small town of Hollywood. Only around 5,000 people lived in Hollywood in 1910. On August 12, 1918, this group scheduled a meeting which resulted in the organization of the Theatre Arts Alliance. The Alliance incorporated on May 25, 1919 and in 1920 reorganized as the Community Park and Art Association. By 1920 the growth of the movie industry had turned this community into a boom-town, with a population close to 50,000. The Association's secretary, Mrs. Artie Mason Carter, was the most active in promoting the project to the community, raising money, and developing plans for a series of symphonic concerts. In fact, the permanent relationship between Hollywood Bowl and the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra began when the orchestra's founder, William Andrews Clark, Jr., agreed to Carter's request that he donate the orchestra's services for the 1921 Easter Sunrise Service. Carter is sometimes referred to as the "mother of the Bowl." The Women's World Peace Concert, held on November 11, 1921 (Armistice Day), was one of the first major events at the Bowl, and on July 11, 1922, Alfred Hertz conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra in the first concert of the first season of "Symphonies Under the Stars."</p><p>Source: <title>Hollywood Bowl Souvenir Book</title>.

This announcement followed an agreement that the Theatre Group under managing director Gordon Davidson would move from UCLA to the Music Center. The formation of the Theatre Group under the auspices of the University of California Extension grew out of a conference of 100 academics and theater professionals from across the country held at Lake Arrowhead in 1958. The CTG presents performances at the Mark Taper Forum and the Ahmanson Theatre, both of which were dedicated on April 12, 1967. The Mark Taper Forum opened on April 9, 1967 with "The Devils," starring Frank Langella and Ed Flanders. The Ahmanson Theatre opened on September 12, 1967 with "More Stately Mansions" starring Ingrid Bergman, Arthur Hill, and Colleen Dewhurst.</p><p>Sources: "Theater Group Named Resident of Music Center," <title>Los Angeles Times</title>, March 20, 1966, Mark Taper Forum and Ahmanson Theatre dedication week files, Box 1,623, Music Center records (Collection 3261).

After tea, sandwiches, and cakes, Chandler announced that she was organizing the Blue Ribbon 400: Blue Ribbon because she liked the name she had given to a committee of women to raise the final $1 million of private funding needed to build the Music Center complex in 1963; and 400 because once the membership reached that number, it would be closed. Blue Ribbon members paid dues, planned, and sponsored the Music Center's social, educational, and cultural activities. </p><p>Blue Ribbon member financial contributions would go to what is now the annual Music Center Unified Fund campaign, which provides support for all the Music Center resident companies: The Los Angeles Philharmonic, Center Theatre Group, Joffrey Ballet, the Los Angeles Music Center Opera, and the Los Angeles Master Chorale.</p><p>Founded in 1976, Club 100 includes more than 100 women who support the performing arts through education, advocacy, and fundraising. The purpose of Club 100 is to train its members and other Music Center volunteer groups to be effective fundraisers for the Music Center Unified Fund and leading volunteers for the Music Center. Club 100's membership contributes more than $500,000 annually to the Center and sponsors the Distinguished Artist Award to honor members of the artistic community. </p><p>Founded in 1978 by Thornton Bradshaw, Charles T. Manatt, and other Music Center supporters,  the Fraternity of Friends is a group of businessmen and entertainment industry executives who share a common interest in the performing arts and believe that the well-being of the Center is directly linked to the betterment of Los Angeles. The Fraternity of Friends' combined membership contributes more than $500,000 annually to the Center.</p><p>LA Alive! is an annual, free, two-day arts festival that celebrates the ethnic diversity of Los Angeles.</p><p>Sources: "The Blue Ribbon Story" researched and written by Betty Goodwin, Box 1,815, Center records (Collection 3261).

The Education Division is committed to the belief that experiencing the arts enhances the quality of life for all people, and is a crucial part of the development of every child. Each year MCED presents performances and other arts programs in hundreds of public and private schools with a full spectrum of arts experiences to nurture the creative potential in students and teachers and to develop future artists, informed audiences, and dedicated arts supporters. The Division's varied programs offer a distinguished roster of artists representing diverse cultures, disciplines, and styles.</p><p>Source: Music Center Performing Arts Center of Los Angeles County press kit, Music Center Education Division, Box 1,964, Music Center records (Collection 3261).

The Hall is the home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Los Angeles Master Chorale. Located on a historic downtown Los Angeles site, Walt Disney Concert Hall is situated on Bunker Hill at the intersection of First Street and Grand Avenue, adjacent to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. A large portion of the site is devoted to an urban public park that is accessible not only from the Hall, but from the adjacent streets. The primary entry plaza, located at the corner of First and Grand, connects the facility to the existing Music Center Plaza, and a secondary entry plaza, located at the corner of 2nd and Grand, provides primary access to the gardens.</p><p>Source: Music Center Performing Arts Center of Los Angeles County press kit, Backgrounder Walt Disney Concert Hall, Box 1,964, Music Center records (Collection 3261).
