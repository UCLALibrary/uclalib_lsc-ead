    <head>Administrative/Biographical History</head>
<p>Robert Harris was a commercial photographer active in South Africa; he maintained a studio in Port Elizabeth between 1880 and 1890. He published two photo books: <title>Photographic views of Port Elizabeth and neighbourhood</title> in 1876; and <title>Photographic album of South African scenery</title> sometime between 1880 and 1886. His album, <title>South Africa: illustrated by a series of one hundred and four permanent photographs</title> was published in Port Elizabeth in 1888. His photographs, which include views of urbanization in the developing cities and towns, and diamond mining in Kimberley, present an image of South Africa at a transformative moment for its economy and society. For additional information, see A.D. Bensusan, "19th century photographers in South Africa," Africana notes and news 15, no. 6 (1963): 219-252.</p>  </bioghist>
