    <head>Biography/History</head>
<p>Edgar Rice Burroughs was born in Chicago, Illinois on September 1, 1875 to Civil War veteran Major George Tyler Burroughs and Mary Evaline (Zieger) Burroughs. He graduated from the Michigan Military Academy in 1895, but failed the entrance exam for the United States Military Academy (West Point). He became an enlisted soldier with the 7th US Cavalry in Fort Grant, Arizona Territory. In 1897, he was diagnosed with a heart problem and honorably discharged. Burroughs married Emma Hulbert in January 1900. They had three children: Joan (b. 1908), Hulbert (b. 1909), and John (b. 1913).  </p><p>Burroughs began to write fiction in 1911. His first story, "Under the Moons of Mars," was serialized in the February to July 1912 issues of <title render="italic">The All-Story</title>, under the pseudonym Norman Bean. <title render="italic">Tarzan of the Apes</title> was published in October 1912, and quickly became a cultural sensation. Burroughs exploited the Tarzan brand through a comic strip, movies, radio programs, and merchandise, to great success. In either 1915 or 1919, Burroughs purchased a large ranch north of Los Angeles, California, which he named "Tarzana." The citizens of the community that formed around the ranch adopted the town name Tarzana in 1927. In 1923, he set up his own company, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. and began printing his own books through the 1930s. He also began Burroughs-Tarzan Productions, an independent film studio.</p><p>Edgar Rice Burroughs divorced Emma Hulbert in 1934. In 1935 he married former actress Florence Gilbert Dearholt, the ex-wife of his friend, Ashton Dearholt. Burroughs adopted the Dearholts' two children. The couple divorced in 1942. </p><p>Burroughs was in Honolulu at the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. He applied for a reporting post, and became one of the oldest U.S. war correspondents during World War II. Burroughs was a political conservative, suspicious of Japanese Americans, and a strong critic of Roosevelt's New Deal politics. Despite this, he advocated against the internment and deportation of Japanese Americans during and after the war, arguing such actions went against the "Americanism" that made the nation great. </p><p>After the war ended, Burroughs moved back to California, and died of a heart attack on March 19, 1950. He wrote almost 80 novels, including the <title render="italic">Tarzan</title> series, the <title render="italic">Barsoom</title> series, and the <title render="italic">Pellucidar</title> series. He is buried in Tarzana, Los Angeles County. He was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2003.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>This collection documents the activities and political opinions of Edgar Rice Burroughs, the California-based science fiction and fantasy author whose iconic characters include John Carter and Tarzan. </p><p>The collection spans from 1875 to 1950, with the bulk of materials coming from the 1920s-1940s, and is in chronological order. It chronicles Burroughs' time in California, Hawaii, and the broader South Pacific. In addition to professional materials, including correspondence, press clippings, unpublished manuscripts, and reporting notebooks, the collection contains a large quantity of personal material, such as letters to and from Burroughs, correspondence among his children, and reflections on his time as a war correspondent during World War II. </p><p>Some of the significant topics represented in these files are: publishing concerns; innovations in media and advertising; the Great Depression; the New Deal; local police; World War II; foreign relations; wartime journalism; the internment of Japanese Americans; wartime rationing; the growth of the science fiction and fantasy genres; and censorship.
