    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>Portfolio includes views of awninged shops along Jakoberstrasse, with onion dome tower of St. Ulrich visible in the distance; narrow leafy Ko?tzergasse, and Perlachberg, a street near the courthouse, in which can be seen the Perlachturm, an 11th-century watchtower remodelled in the early 17th-century to include bell chamber, lantern, and gold-plated weather vane, and the 12th-century church St Peter am Perlach. One photo documents the early corbie gabled houses of the Fuggerei, the oldest social settlement in the world, founded in 1516 by Jacob Fugger to provide housing for Augsburg's poor and pensioners, and still in operation today. There are also photos of other important architectural and historical landmarks of Augsburg, including the Rotes Tor (Red Gate), the main entrance to the city on the south; the 15th-century Vogeltor (Bird Gate) along the eastern wall of the city; the seven-storied Rathaus or Town Hall built by Elias Holl in 1615-1624, adjacent to the Franciscan convent, Kloster Maria Stern, built by Johannes Holl (Elias' father) in 1574-1576, with one of the earliest examples of the Welsche Haube, or onion dome; the Fronhof palace, former residence of the prince bishops of Augsburg, and its tower, the only remaining part of the original building; and the basilica of St. Ulrich und Afra, founded in the 11th century as a Benedictine monastery, whose Renaissance tower is topped by a famous onion dome visible throughout the city.</p>  </scopecontent>
