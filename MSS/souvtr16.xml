    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>Hammerschmidt's albumen silver prints, printed using a collodion glass negative, document the great mosques, temples, tombs, and other archaeological sites of Egypt, especially in Cairo, Alexandria, Luxor, Aswan, and Abu Simbel. Photos of Alexandria include views of the Place des Consuls, and Pompey's Pillar. In Cairo, there are many photos of the Citadel, and the Mosque of Muhammed Ali, as well as the area around the Citadel, including the striped facades of mosques and minarets. The album contains views of many of the antiquities sites, such as Dandara, the temples of Luxor viewed from the Nile, the massive columns of the temple at Karnak, the temple of Ramses III at Medina Habu, and the temple pylons at Idfu and Philae. In Aswan, feluccas, or traditional Egyptian sailboats, line the riverbank at Aswan, and there is also a view of Elephantine Island in the Nile. The album concludes with the Great Temple of Abu Simbel near the southern border with Sudan.</p>  </scopecontent>
