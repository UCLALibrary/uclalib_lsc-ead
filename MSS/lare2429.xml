The film traveled internationally at film festivals for decades following its release, and these files contain a significant amount of ephemera from those festivals. These papers also contain press clippings and promotional materials from both the United States and internationally about Passing Through. This series also contains correspondence to Clark, photographs, and film strips from his films <title>Passing Through</title> and <title>As Above, So Below</title> (1973). </p><p>The second series within the LA Rebellion collection contains the papers of LA Rebellion filmmaker Julie Dash. They primarily focus on her 1991 film <title>Daughters of the Dust</title> though the collection does contain some materials for <title>Diary of an African Nun</title> (1977) and <title>Illusions</title> (1982). This collection contains a significant number of press clippings about Dash and her works, from both the United States and international news sources. These papers also contain flyers, brochures, and other ephemera from the many film festivals (both within and outside of the United States) and screenings that showcased Dash's films. This series also contains information about awards won by Dash, critical writings by others about her films, information about the production process for her films including screenplays, and additional ephemera and correspondence relating to Dash and her works.</p>  </scopecontent>
