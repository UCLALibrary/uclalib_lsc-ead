    <head>Biography/History</head>
<p>Waldo Phelps was born on June 15, 1918 in San Francisco, California. He grew up in Santa Barbara and began studies at the state college there, which would later become UC Santa Barbara. Phelps received his MA in speech communication from University of Denver in 1941 and then served in the United States Navy. After being discharged, Phelps received his PhD in rhetoric from USC in 1949 and began teaching in the English department at UCLA in the same year. Phelps was instrumental in the founding of the Department of Speech and served as chair from 1964-1971. Phelps' oratory skills were successfully used to campaign for additional funding for the UCLA campus and they led him to be named chairman of the Communication on Public Ceremonies in 1960. Phelps retired from UCLA in 1988 and returned to Santa Barbara where he was active in the alumni association. Waldo Phelps died in Santa Barbara on January 31, 2004 at age 85.</p>  </bioghist>
