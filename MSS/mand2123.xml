    <head>Biography/History</head>
<p>Alan Mandell is an accomplished theater and film actor, theater manager, stage director, and producer. He is considered a foremost interpreter and scholar of Samuel Beckett's works. He was born "Albert" on December 27, 1927 to a Jewish family in Toronto, Canada, but officially changed his name to "Alan" in 1968. After serving as the Artistic Director of Theater '49 in Toronto in the early 1950s, he subsequently spent most of his working life in San Francisco, New York, and Los Angeles.</p><p>Mandell became involved with the San Francisco Actor's Workshop in 1954 while visiting his sister, and he helped the group's co-founders Jules Irving and Herbert Blau transform the Actor's Workshop into one of the first full-fledged regional theater companies in the United States. On November 19, 1957, the Workshop put on a historically significant performance of its production of Beckett's Waiting for Godot in San Quentin Prison, which was later discussed in Martin Esslin's influential Theatre of the Absurd (1961). Mandell, as Lucky, struck a chord with the prisoners, and he ended up co-founding the San Quentin Drama Workshop with inmate Rick Cluchey, who would go on to become an actor and playwright. During this period, Mandell also met his future wife, Elizabeth Heller, and the two were married in 1967.</p><p>When Irving and Blau were selected to run the Repertory Theatre at Lincoln Center in New York, they asked Mandell to join them in Manhattan as the company's manager. Blau left the Repertory after only a year, but Irving and Mandell remained through 1973. In the mid-1970s, Mandell moved west and joined the Los Angeles Actors' Theatre, which would transform into the Los Angeles Theatre Center in 1985. He served as a consulting director and actor, and he developed and oversaw the Poetry/Literary Series at the Center.</p><p>In addition to his time with these four major companies, Mandell worked on a wide range of seminal theatrical and film productions throughout his career, including the 1973 Broadway revival of A Streetcar Named Desire and J.C. Mitchell's 2001 film, Hedwig and the Angry Inch. Both he and Rick Cluchey collaborated directly with Beckett throughout the 1980s and continue to appear in productions of Beckett's plays.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>Materials in this collection document Mandell's professional career and include managerial records, scripts, signed monographs, photographs, clippings, and correspondence with many notable literary and theater figures, including Samuel Beckett. Contents may be of interest to scholars of literature, theater, performance studies, and arts management. The Beckett materials provide an unusually comprehensive portrait of the writer's intentions with respect to staging his work. The theater company records—which include financial documents, grant applications, interoffice communications, press, and programs—provide insight into the process of balancing the practical and artistic goals of running a repertory. The files related to particular theater and film productions not connected to those companies are more commonplace; they consist primarily of contracts, fan-mail, rehearsal photographs, reviews, shooting schedules, and unmarked scripts. Digital materials (5 optical discs, 1 zip drive) primarily contain promotional images and audio/visual recordings of Mandell's work.</p>  </scopecontent>

Mandell; Mandell's detailed rehearsal notes from productions in which he was directed by Beckett; scripts and monographs annotated by both Beckett and Mandell; and photographs from rehearsals and performances. In addition to the aesthetic value of the letters, these materials have substantial historical value for Beckett biographers and scholars of literature and drama in part because they capture the writer's goals as a director in a range of formats: annotations, correspondence, Mandell's notes, and photographs. As a contrast, a substantial portion of the Beckett materials are from productions with which Beckett himself was not directly involved, including the 2012 production of Waiting for Godot at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. Monographs were cataloged at the item level and can be found in UCLA Library's Online Catalog.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref7_vwi" level="file"><did><unittitle>Abbey Theatre</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1980/1980" type="inclusive">1980</unitdate><container id="aspace_71330cb1329e9ef4e4383e0ea5b77b52" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">13</container><container id="aspace_0977f0cd84cb6b0268b92c18bf6b9908" parent="aspace_71330cb1329e9ef4e4383e0ea5b77b52" type="folder">1</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref8_bis" level="file"><did><unittitle>Alan Mandell Performs Beckett</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1990/1990" type="inclusive">1990</unitdate><container id="aspace_63c94e238c32ccc8dbc4d9267d73e709" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">13</container><container id="aspace_69ff9851010fa16abbb3b791c758b495" parent="aspace_63c94e238c32ccc8dbc4d9267d73e709" type="folder">2</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref9_n10" level="file"><did><unittitle>Barcelona</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1990/1990" type="inclusive">1990</unitdate><container id="aspace_631c2d58bbdb324112138dc7f8016910" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">13</container><container id="aspace_5e5485fef0b324fc6e1063e88aeba572" parent="aspace_631c2d58bbdb324112138dc7f8016910" type="folder">3</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref58_v9m" level="file"><did><unittitle>The Beckett Circle</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1981/1983" type="inclusive">1981-1983</unitdate><container id="aspace_66a2a2539e9262e6c762df8b026a00bc" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">13</container><container id="aspace_8cc906bd7c903f5cd11834bb3bad8aae" parent="aspace_66a2a2539e9262e6c762df8b026a00bc" type="folder">4</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref59_c4n" level="file"><did><unittitle>Beckett Directs Beckett -

Daniel Selznick to Mandell that were inserted into Mandell's copy of Daniel's father's biography, Showman: The Life of David O. Selznick by David Thompson (Box 17). The first note is handwritten and from 1952. The second note is from June 18, 2011, and was written by Daniel as if he were Alan Mandell apologizing to "Danny." Mandell explains in an attached note, "This letter was written by Daniel Selznick. He sent it to me to chastise me for not thanking him for the theater tickets. I did thank him. He has a hearing problem, among other problems."</p></scopecontent></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref550_d29" level="file"><did><unittitle>Sevilla, Jose</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation"
