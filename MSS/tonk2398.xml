Virtually all of the pages of the album have become detached from the binding. The postcards depict life in Tonkin, or northern Vietnam, especially Hanoi and surrounding areas, during French colonial rule. The date 1905 comes from an inscription in the front of the album and may not reflect the creation date of the cards themselves.</p></scopecontent></c01></dsc>
