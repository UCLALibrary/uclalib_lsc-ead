He requested a wilderness post, and was sent to posts along the north shore of the St. Lawrence (1846-47). His recollections were published in 1848 and titled <title>Hudson's Bay; or, every-day life in the wilds of North America</title>. He wrote more than 90 books, many of them adventure stories. He was also a draftsman and water-colorist who exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy, and he illustrated many of his books. The collection consists of manuscripts, correspondence, and a scrapbook with pictures of Ballantyne, clippings about him, and an article copied by Westley about Ballantyne.</abstract>
