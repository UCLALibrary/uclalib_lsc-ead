    <head>Biographical Narrative</head>
<p>Verne Dyson was born in Calloway County, Missouri, in 1879. He spent his youth and early manhood in Missouri, Clayton, New Mexico, and graduated from West Denver High School in 1900. He attended Central College, Missouri, and graduated from that institution in 1905. He entered the career of journalism and in 1907 became the feature writer for the <title type="simple">Kansas City Star</title>.</p><p>In 1907 Mr. Dyson joined the staff of the <title type="simple">Los Angeles Times</title> as manager of the Pasadena News Bureau and Sunday Editor. At this time he became interested in California history and associated himself with George W. Hazard in the Hazard Historical Association to produce a history of the Los Angeles region. When George Hazard died in 1914, Dyson purchased his extensive collection of historical materials from the Hazard family and determined to complete the history of Los Angeles. Sustained by his collecting proclivities, the Collection grew to over ten thousand items. He continued his research for the history of Los Angeles and completed a manuscript which is part of this collection.</p><p>At the close of the first World War, Dyson went to Shanghai, China, to become Dean of Williams College. In 1921 he became professor of English and Chinese history at the University of the Philippines in Manila and helped to found the Philippine Academy of Social Sciences there. He received the appointment of Director of the Chinese Studies Institute in 1933, and from 1940 to 1961 he served as Curator of the Walt Whitman Museum at Huntington, Long Island, New York. While engaged in this work, he also founded the <title type="simple">Brentwood</title>, <title type="simple">New York Bulletin</title> and the <title type="simple">Walt Whitman Quarterly</title>. Since 1961 Mr. Dyson has been retired and living in Los Angeles.</p><p>Verne Dyson is the author of a number of books and many articles. His literary papers described in this register include his correspondence, research notes and unpublished manuscripts as well as photographs and other related printed matter which he collected in connection with his research interests.</p>  </bioghist>
