Kashifi gives the history of the fables from the "Indian" version of Bidpay (3a), to Burziyah's Pahlavi (3a), Ibn al-Muqann? [sic] in Arabic (3b), Ridaki's Persian in verse (3b), and the prose Persian version of Bahram Shah Ghaznawid (3b). Kashifi states (4a) that the book was in danger of not being read on account of the difficulties in the language of the Bahram Shah version, which he (Kashifi) has now undertaken to make more accessible to his contemporaries (4a-5b). This was suggested to him by (4b) Amir Shaykh A?mad, known as al-Suhayli (d. 1501-3 CE), hence the second title of the book and the pun on Suhayl, or the star Canopus. The work was done at the time of the Timurid Sultan ?usayn Bayqara (4b), who reigned in Heart until 1506 CE.</p><p><list type="simple"><item>Author: Kashifi, ?usayn Va ?i?, d. 1504 or 5</item><item>Language: Text in Persian</item><item>Origin: Persia</item><item>Layout: Average of 21 lines of text per page.</item><item>Decoration: Illuminated title page.</item><item>Binding: Black laquered book cover with floral ornamentation.</item><item>Additional description: Punctuation and introductory words in red ink.

This is the second volume of Samarqandi's history of the Ilkhanid Mongols, Tamerlane, and the Timurids. Volume two covers the sons of Tamerlane up to ca. 1469 CE; also including the enthronement of Sul?an ?usayn Bayqara, ca. 1470 CE. While the first volume of this book borrowed from several other histories, the second volume reported the events that were contemporary, or near contemporary, with the author. The focus is mostly on events in Khurasan and Transoxiana, with due attention given to events in Iraq and Azerbayjan. The reign of the following Timurid Emirs are covered with varying degree of detail: Pir Mu?ammad, Rustam, Khalil Sul?an, ?Umar Shaykh, Shah Rukh, Ulugh Beg, ?bd al-La?if, ?bd Allah, Abi S? id, Sul?an A?mad, Ma?mid, and ?usayn Bayqara. The book also contains the report of the author's travels to India as an ambassador and his account of the strange things that he had seen there. The author refers to himself and his date of composition in a number of other instances, for example 58a (at the end of the section on Shahrukh's school and hospice built in Heart ca. 1410), or when he mentions his interview with Shahrukh ca. 1437 (192b).</p><p><list type="simple"><item>Author: ?bd al-Razzaq Kamal al-Din ibn Is?aq al-Samarqandi, 1413-1482</item><item>Scribe: ?bd al-Mi'min ibn Maq?id ?li al-Mu?allim</item><item>Language: Text in Persian</item><item>Origin: [Northeast Persia or Afghanistan?]</item><item>Layout: Average of 21 lines of text per page.</item><item>Decoration: Illuminated title page.</item><item>Binding: Red leather binding with gilt stamping.</item><item>Additional description: Chapter headings, Koranic verses, and the words "verse" or "poem" in red ink.

Recto has a flower and bird illustration set inside a yellow circle against a green background with thin gilded borders. Verso has two illustrations, one on the top half of the board, and another on the bottom. These show a number of women in what seems to be sequences from a story. The figures are drawn in black outline, wearing green and red dresses, and are set against a dark yellow and green background with a red border. Both boards are in poor condition. There is badly faded text in red ink over one of the story illustrations; the first word of the text appears to be "majlis," meaning assembly, and the second word is "Zulaykha". The scene is probably from Jami's romance of Yisuf and Zulaykha (see ms. 1656/3), where Zulaykha and other women were so awestruck by Yisuf's beauty that they peel the skin of their hands instead of the fruits they are holding. The covers may have been designed to contain a version of Jami's versified romance (completed 1483 CE). Below these two words is the date 1043 AH (1633-4 CE).</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref144_j60" level="item"><did><unittitle>[Book cover]</unittitle><unitid>Manuscript no. 44</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">n.d.</unitdate><physdesc id="aspace_fae1074c11a174663080bc47cbcc9430" label="General Physical Description note">1 lacquered book cover : paper-m√¢ch√© ; 365 √ó 227 mm.</physdesc><container id="aspace_5e1ae6ec51f06853b1aca8631e9fffbb" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">4</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_93638de49de3986dd3af56c21a4097fb"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Lacquered book cover with decorative floral ornamentation and leather spine.
