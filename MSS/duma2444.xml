    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Sharif Dumani is a first-generation Costa Rican/Lebanese American native of Los Angeles, an archivist with an MLIS degree from UCLA, and a multi-instrumental musician. As a musician, he has played, recorded, and toured with a wide range of underground artists including Alice Bag (The Bags), Terry Graham (The Bags, Gun Club, Cramps), Jowe Head (Swell Maps, Television Personalities), Cody ChesnuTT, Silver Apples, Nick Garrie, as well as groups Exploding Flowers, Sex Stains (ex Bratmobile, Warpaint), and Classics of Love (ex Operation Ivy). He grew up in the Southern California punk of the late-1980s, going to shows, forming bands, and performing by the early 1990s. He is still an active participant in L.A.'s underground music community, and continues to contribute to the history of punk as being a diverse pathway for connection, community, critical thinking, consciousness, and, if we're lucky, love.</p>  </bioghist>
