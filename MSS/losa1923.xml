    <head>Biography/History</head>
<p>The Los Angeles City Board of Education serves as the governing, policy-making body for the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), which was previously composed of three districts: the Los Angeles City School District that served kindergarten through 8th grade and formed on September 19, 1853; the Los Angeles City High School District that served grades 9 through 12 and formed in 1890; and the Los Angeles City Junior College District formed in 1931. As a result of the school unification election of June 7, 1960, the elementary and high school districts merged to form the LAUSD on July 1, 1961. Since July 1, 1969, the Los Angeles Junior College District has been governed by a separate Board of Trustees.</p><p>The first ordinance establishing public schools in Los Angeles was passed by the Common Council on July 25, 1853. This ordinance provided for the Council's appointment of three Commissioners of Public Schools to serve as a City Board of Education with the chairman to serve as the Superintendent of Schools. </p><p>At the next meeting of the Council, J. Lancaster Brent, Lewis Granger and Stephen C. Foster were appointed members of the Board of Education. J. Lancaster Brent served as chairman of the Board and Superintendent. Stephen C. Foster assumed the office of mayor in May 1854 and during his inaugural address, urged the necessity of increased school facilities as the city did not yet own a school building. </p><p>Foster recommended the building of two school houses, the revision of the ordinance governing the schools, and the appointment of a school superintendent and school marshal. At the next Council meeting, an ordinance was presented and passed, providing for the Council's appointment of three school trustees, a superintendent and a school marshal on the first Monday of June each year.</p><p>Before the close of the school year, School House No. 1, a two-story brick building located on the corner of Spring and Second streets was completed and opened on March 19, 1855. School House No. 2, a two-room building located at the junction of North Main and Los Angeles streets was built in 1856.</p><p>From 1853 to 1866 the Common Council appointed the members of the Board of Education and the school superintendents. From 1866 to 1870 the three member School Boards and the Superintendents were elected by popular vote at the city elections. In 1870 when it was discovered that there was no legal authority for the office of superintendent, this office ceased to exist from 1870 to 1873.</p><p>In 1872, a special act of the legislature created a City Board of Education, consisting of five members elected at large, and gave it the authority to appoint a superintendent of schools. Although not required, from 1873 to 1889 the Board members held partisan offices.</p><p>A new city charter adopted in 1889 authorized a nine-member Board, one member from each political ward of the city and the Board maintained its authority to appoint a superintendent. During the period of 1880-1890, the population of the city increased from 11,000 to 50,000. </p><p>After a period of general unrest and dissatisfaction with the ward system, charges of bribery were made against certain Board members during 1897-1898 and citizens demanded changes. As a result, the ward system was abolished in 1904 and a new city charter restored the at-large, non-partisan Board of Education and reduced its nine members to seven.</p><p>From 1904 to 1978, each member was chosen by the entire electorate of the LAUSD. Although during the latter years of this period, each Board member was assigned an Office number (Offices No. 1 through 7), the entire electorate still chose each member for each office. </p><p>With the passage of a City Charter Amendment, Proposition M on November 7, 1978, the District was divided into seven geographical areas or Districts. These Districts were also numbered 1 through 7 but did not coincide with the old Office numbers, nor was there any relation between the two. </p><p>The election for odd-numbered Districts was held in the spring of 1979 and members were seated July 1, 1979. The election for even-numbered Districts was held in the spring of 1981 and members were seated July 1, 1981. Thus, the term "Office" when used in connection with a Board of Education seat became obsolete with the beginning of the school year on July 1, 1981. Board of Education members were then spoken of as representing a numerically designated District.</p><p>Today the LAUSD is still governed by a seven-member Board of Education elected directly by voters of its seven Districts. Board members are elected for terms of four years and elections are held every other year with three members chosen at one election and four at the next. The Board appoints a Superintendent for a four-year term who serves as the chief executive officer of the Board and the school system. </p><p>The District encompasses approximately 710 square miles, includes virtually all of the City of Los Angeles, many other cities and several unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County. The LAUSD is the largest public school system in California based on pupil enrollment and the second largest public school district in the United States. </p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>The Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education records range from 1875-2012. The collection consists of Minutes books, Board and committee reports, administrative guides, annual reports, bulletins, classification reports, index cards, financial records, school and teacher directories, maps, publications and research files. </p><p>The first series, Minutes, and the third series, Subject Files, comprise the bulk of the collection. The Minutes (also called Board Reports) span 137 years and are the District's official record of business. The Subject Files cover 759 subjects and are records that serve as supporting documentation for the Minutes. </p><p>The Board Secretariat or Executive Officer of the Board, formerly the Clerk of the Board, was responsible for the stewardship of these records. The Board Secretariat's File and Minutes Units maintained these records for use by the Superintendent, Board members, District staff and the public.</p><p>The enduring value of the LAUSD Board of Education records lies within the evidential and informational records maintained by the Board. These records contain historical evidence of the Board's organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, and operations which speak to the origins of its existence, its work and achievements. These records provide essential information on all matters with which the Board dealt including staff, students, parents, organizations, land matters, politics, events, programs, war emergencies, natural disasters and civil unrest. </p>  </scopecontent>

Regular Board Minutes reflect a standard Order of Business which shifts over time but historically occurs in the following order: Roll Call of Members, Approval of Minutes, Reports from Standing and Special Committees, Special Reports from the Superintendent, Communications and Petitions, Miscellaneous Business and Adjournment. Noticed motions and resolutions are voted upon by the Board and when carried, result in the creation of District policy. In addition to regular meeting Minutes, the Board generates Minutes for its special meetings which are open to the public and agendas for its closed sessions. Annual meetings are held on July 1st of each year during which the Board elects one of its members as President whose term of office continues for one year or until a successor is elected. At the annual meeting, the Board President designates the standing committees for the year. Standing committees change over time with the Board's shifting functions and priorities. For example, in 1964 the President appointed a chairman and two other members to each of the following standing committees: Budget and Finance, Building, Cafeterias, Insurance, Law and Rules, Personnel and Schools, Purchasing, Transportation and the Committee of the Whole which consists of all Board members.</p><p>The Minutes include the following documents as attachments: Census Marshal's Reports, Controller's Annual Financial Reports, bond election returns, Communications and Reports from Standing Committees, Ad-Hoc Committees, Superintendents and speakers who address the Board.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref193_f12" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Los Angeles Unified School District</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1875/2009" type="inclusive">1875 May 19-2009 June 23</unitdate></did><c03 id="aspace_ref2273_0rs" level="file"><did><unittitle>Volume A Board of Education Minutes</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1875 May 19-1880 November </unitdate><container id="aspace_9ce2da77c485304aa3a38cec6ddbe9f6" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">831</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_567c37fe688afce6756115f469a2945f"><head>Scope and Content</head><p>Board meetings held in the rooms of the Commercial Bank or at Board members' residences and offices.

Barrows absent. </p><p>On June 25, 1875, the Board carried a motion to change the salary of the teacher of the colored school from $70 to $80 a month. At a special meeting on December 18, 1875, Mr. James suggested that rules be adopted for regular transactions of business and formed a committee of one to study this issue. On January 13, 1876, the Board adopted its rules and carried a motion to support drafting a bill to be forwarded to Sacramento to enable the Board to issue bonds. On February 11, 1876, the Board carried a resolution concerning "houses of ill repute" in the vicinity of the Bath Street School. On August 17, 1876, due to overcrowding of public schools, the Board resolved to exclude all pupils who are not residing within the District's limits. On April 5, 1879, the Board received a communication concerning misappropriation of funds by the Vernon School District. On August 18, 1879, the Board discussed salaries of certificated teachers. On March 6, 1880, the Board moved that the Committee on Discipline examine conditions of two overcrowded schools. On March 15, 1880, the Board adopted a resolution to allow the Trustees of the State Normal School use of rooms in the High School to accommodate a branch of the Normal School until a building is erected. On July 19, 1880, the Board elected Mrs. C.B. Jones as Superintendent of the Public Schools of the City. On August 7, 1880, Mrs. C.B.

McKinley concerning the necessary restrictions for the prevention of contagious diseases in the public schools. On April 6, 1886, a resolution was presented and read with no response or action taken by the Board, asking the School Department's cooperation in ridding the City of the Chinese, a curse to youth in immorality. On May 17, 1886, the Board met in special session to arrange the move of Central School house in whole or in part. On September 18, 1886, the Secretary was instructed to ask the Chief of Police to station a policeman at the Central Building while it was being moved across Temple Street. On February 12, 1887, the Board discussed amendments to the Charter which would be more beneficial to the School Department than those proposed by the City Council. On September 27, 1887, the Secretary was directed to correspond with the Secretary of the San Francisco School Board concerning the manner of conducting night schools so that Los Angeles may establish its own.

These copies of motions and resolutions include subjects, dates noticed, presentation for action dates, names of  Board members who presented and seconded the action, individual Board member votes or abstentions and a record of the action taken: carried, failed or referred and if referred, date returned to Board.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref3911_dis" level="file"><did><unittitle>Motions/Resolutions From 1979-1989 Made By Past Board Members</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1979-1989</unitdate><container id="aspace_4f336eb2d50a8b7e1a8a6b8e16d97ed6" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">2094</container><container id="aspace_58e39f5f011fd766cec5d24b7a6c0110" parent="aspace_4f336eb2d50a8b7e1a8a6b8e16d97ed6" type="folder">1</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5ebf08e16a5ae24fa9c9fa4fa648a084"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Binder of Board motions/resolutions organized by year of presentation.</p></scopecontent></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref3913_v9f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Volume I: Motions Made By Past Board Members</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1979-1995</unitdate><container id="aspace_6a33d7fc17004fd76c51d0ff8b636358" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">2094</container><container id="aspace_1ba723ad2c266ee3f463266c2f1b6427" parent="aspace_6a33d7fc17004fd76c51d0ff8b636358" type="folder">2</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_0921e00a0adb62cd1be94dfaf5d41449"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Binder of motions/resolutions organized by Board member and then chronologically by date of presentation.</p></scopecontent></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref3916_pdc" level="file"><did><unittitle>Volume II: Motions Made By Past Board Members</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1980-1997</unitdate><container id="aspace_303cccb7c0ee5d67f6b379fac4037dc3" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">2095</container><container id="aspace_141d7a3b4475a292afb17647591514f8" parent="aspace_303cccb7c0ee5d67f6b379fac4037dc3" type="folder">1</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_cf096c146210e2f90e1f57551841b4f2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Binder of motions/resolutions organized by Board member and then chronologically by date of presentation.</p></scopecontent></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref3918_859" level="file"><did><unittitle>Motions By Past Board Members From 1991</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1991-2007</unitdate><container id="aspace_76f74f821940d52e07acccfc63a64610" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">2095</container><container id="aspace_ad1e682e3d5a094d8422330d6cd4eea6" parent="aspace_76f74f821940d52e07acccfc63a64610" type="folder">2</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1abff609f2b64740f7609dac68a03abf"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Binder of motions/resolutions organized by Board member and then chronologically by date of presentation.</p></scopecontent></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref3920_12e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Motions 1992 &amp;

The investigation focused on Arabzadeh's allegations in three general areas: That the District engaged in an ongoing campaign of cover-up and concealment of serious environmental hazards and problems, that the District ignored the advice of its own staff to conduct adequate environmental testing of the area surrounding Jefferson Middle School and that the District mishandled the environmental problems at the Belmont Learning Complex project, cutting the Environmental Health and Safety Branch out of the process.</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref2805_eaq" level="file"><did><unittitle>Environmental Impact Report</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1978 September 18-2008 December 9</unitdate><container id="aspace_a12af697864b16f9516f03b0f9e19d44" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">1259</container><container id="aspace_0dc69441af257370492341bdbaae80b0" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">1260</container><container id="aspace_33089a2cf936438e9afb6a6ae4e646af" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">1261</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_6cc0c3c11566a779928c9e29c4eb56c2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Environmental Impact Reports (EIRs), Reports of Findings and Statements of Overriding Considerations, Comments and Responses to Reports, Crawford v.

This budget allows the Superintendent and the Board to set priorities and allocate resources for the upcoming fiscal year. This process begins with the establishment of a Budget Calendar, continues with the creation of the Provisional Budget, and after a public hearing, culminates with the presentation and approval of the Final Budget to the Board. During this process, the Superintendent, staff, employees, employee organizations, members of the public and community groups may present budget recommendations and requests to the Board prior to its final adoption. Files are arranged chronologically by fiscal year. Materials include proposed expenditures, requests, petitions, refund allowances, budget policies, reserve amounts, detail budgets, tentative budgets, final budgets, budget calendars, lay-off petitions, salary ratings, financial data, executive summaries, and information regarding school norms.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref4548_obz" level="file"><did><unittitle>Budget</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1938/1939" type="inclusive">1938-1939</unitdate><container id="aspace_fe3017cf253b126d2a1d6a235897dce3" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">2350</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_6b8f1608fcb030793e91f5fa40c0c299"><head>Scope and Content</head><p>Materials include the controller's monthly financial report from 1935 and budget documents pertaining to the year 1940.</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref4550_s2f" level="collection"><did><unittitle>Budget </unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1939/1940" type="inclusive">1939-1940</unitdate><container id="aspace_c9f8802fb328fc68d5fd3e095a9df5b1" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">2351</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref4591_1mp" level="file"><did><unittitle>Budget</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1941/1942" type="inclusive">1941-1942</unitdate><container id="aspace_eff5936ae7426214d4b7d5062143ceb9" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">2352</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref4554_9cm" level="file"><did><unittitle>Budget</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1942/1943" type="inclusive">1942-1943</unitdate><container id="aspace_9177950f33facb7537c5f836b553799b" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">2353</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref4555_n51" level="file"><did><unittitle>Budget

Each rule is assigned a one, two, three or four digit number and each regulation predicated upon a specific rule bears the number of that rule followed by a hyphen and another number.

These are arranged chronologically and are also indexed by subject. Additionally, from December 1941 through July 1945, the Superintendent generated War Emergency Bulletins, War Emergency Special Bulletins and War Emergency Curriculum Supplements. In 1945, the indices reflect the inclusion of bulletins generated by various divisions such as Budget, Business, Controlling, Curriculum, Personnel and Secretarial. The content of these bulletins includes statements of District policies and procedures that were retained for permanent file until revised or rescinded. The August 9, 1962 Division of Instructional Services Memorandum states, "Bulletins are bound at the end of each school year, and become official records of the Board of Education."</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref4749_swv" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bulletins</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1923-1927</unitdate><container

compiled by the Los Angeles City School District Clerk, submitted to the County Superintendent and then to the State Superintendent of Public Instruction in Sacramento. Most reports list names of District clerks, Board members and include signatures of the District and County Superintendents. These are statistical reports which capture census data on race of pupils until 1909, enrollment by sex, average daily attendance and absences. Reports also record financial statistics such as teacher, principal and superintendent salaries, average cost per pupil estimates, expenditures and valuation of property. Additional statistics include number of school houses, type of material used for construction, names of schools, locations, years of establishment and names of principals.</p></scopecontent><c02

According to Kersey, its purpose is to serve "the educational needs of children and their better satisfaction through the exchange of ideas, reports of activities, analysis of conditions and inspiration." The June 1941 issue includes features on Americanism, the R.O.T.C. and the impact of the District's national defense training program.</p></scopecontent></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref4972_6my" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Who's Who Registers</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1972/1980" type="inclusive">1972-1980</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e9eea062790dd4fb24536875e6fbfdf7"><head>Scope and Content</head><p>Bound lists of notable alumni organized alphabetically by area and school name.
