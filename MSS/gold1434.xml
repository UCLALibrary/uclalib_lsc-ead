    <head>Biography/History</head>
<p>Golden State Mutual founder William Nickerson, Jr. moved to Los Angeles from Texas in 1921 as an official representative of the Texas-based insurance company American Mutual Benefit Association. When he arrived in California, he soon discovered that the state's existing insurance agencies viewed its 40,000 Black citizens as either uninsurables or extraordinary risks. Black residents were only accepted at discriminatory premium rates, or  denied insurance coverage altogether.</p><p>Nickerson struggled for three years, succeeded in insuring more than 2,000 Californians, only to find that the Texas firm would not renew its California license. To fulfill the promise of protection made to the 2,000 policyowners, Nickerson had to set up a new company. He joined forces with Norman O. Houston, a young insurance salesman from Northern California and George A. Beavers, Jr., a Georgia-born Los Angeles businessman and church leader. Together, in 1924, the three began to shape their dream of creating a Black-owned and operated insurance company. </p><p>The state's insurance code required a thorough knowledge of California law governing corporations in general and insurance companies in particular. Nickerson purchased a set of law books, began to study California insurance law and discovered a soon-to-expire law under which the company could be organized as an assessment company. This required that the organizers secure at least 500 applications for life insurance, with premiums paid in advance and that they deposit $15,000 with the state treasurer as a guarantee fund.</p><p>Nickerson managed the project, Houston raised the $15,000 through the sale of Certificates of Advancement, and Beavers secured 500 paid applications. Twelve hours before the expiration of the old assessment law, Nickerson, Houston and Beavers received a telegram from the California Department of Insurance informing them that a license to operate had been granted to the Golden State Mutual Guarantee Fund Insurance Company of Los Angeles.</p><p>The Company operated out of a 12 by 14 foot second story office at 1435 Central Avenue leased by Board Member and Medical Director Dr. H. H. Towles. The Company was comprised of President William Nickerson, Jr., Secretary and Treasurer Norman O. Houston, Vice-President and Director of Agencies George A. Beavers, Jr., Clerk Helen E. Batiste, and a few agents such as Edgar J. Johnson. After 79 days, the Company moved to a storefront office at 3512 Central Avenue. By the end of 1925, GSM had paid its first death claim and transferred Johnson up north to open and manage its first District Office in Oakland. </p><p>Groundbreaking ceremonies for the Company's first Home Office Building were held on August 7, 1928. This 2-story building was located at 4111 Central Avenue. Between 1926 and 1929, GSM established District Offices in Pasadena, Bakersfield, San Diego, Fresno, El Centro and Sacramento.</p><p>Changing its name from the Golden State Guarantee Fund Insurance Company to Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company in 1931, the firm continued to expand. In July of 1938, GSM extended its services to Illinois for the Company's first venture across California boundaries.</p><p>During the 1940s, expansion in California saw District Offices established in San Francisco, San Bernardino, Vallejo and Fresno. On January 2, 1942, GSM converted from an assessment company to the more stable status of an old line legal reserve insurer. Out of state expansion carried GSM services to Nickerson's home state of Texas – to Dallas in 1944 and to Houston a year later. The May 27, 1945 opening of the Houston office was the realization of Nickerson's 20-year ambition. Less than six months afterwards, founder William Nickerson, Jr. died on November 14, 1945.</p><p>Nickerson's passing brought organizational change to GSM. Norman O. Houston was elected President after serving 20 years as Corporate Secretary and Treasurer. George A. Beavers, Jr. was elected Chairman of the Board and Edgar J. Johnson, became Corporate Secretary.</p><p>GSM's continued expansion required that it build a final Home Office in 1948. Designed by architect Paul Revere Williams, this five story structure was completed in the heart of Los Angeles at the intersection of Western Avenue and Adams Boulevard in 1949. The Company's Historical Murals, depicting the history of the Negro in California by Charles Alston and Hale Woodruff were unveiled during the opening week ceremonies for this new building on August 19, 1949.</p><p>During the 1950s GSM entered three new states: Oregon, Washington and Arizona. In 1954, the Board of Directors formally declared the Golden Rule as the Company's business philosophy. As a symbolic reminder of this principle, the Company began the practice of presenting to each new employee a marble inscribed with the phrase: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. In 1957 the Company adopted a new graphic and coined a new nickname for its field representatives. The Golden State agent was reimagined as the Man With The Golden Pen, a name which emphasized the importance of the field underwriter's services to families.</p><p>Expansion of services to Michigan and Indiana in 1960 led the Company to enlist a veteran insurance agent from Detroit named Ernest Shell as Assistant Agency Officer. Shell was later to become Senior Vice President, Agency Director and a member of the Company's Board of Directors. During the same year as the Watts riots, GSM celebrated its 40th anniversary and dedicated the Golden State Mutual Afro-American Art Collection. In 1967, George A. Beavers, Jr. resigned as Chairman of the Board. Houston, President since 1945, was elected Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Edgar J. Johnson, who had served as Executive Vice-President since 1956, was named President and Chief Administrative Officer.</p><p>The onset of the 1970s was marked by major management changes. Norman O. Houston retired from active management but remained in the service of the Company as Chairman of the Board of Directors. Edgar J. Johnson also retired but remained as management consultant, member of the Board of Directors and Executive Committee. Ivan J. Houston was elected President and Chief Executive Officer in 1970 and in 1977 when his father vacated his Board Chairmanship, Ivan J. Houston was elected to fill this role in addition to his other duties. By the end of this decade, the Company was licensed to do business in 22 states and the District of Columbia.</p><p>Between 1980 and the end of 1984, insurance in force with GSM increased to $4,527,611,000, maintaining its rank as the second largest Black life insurer in the United States by this measure. Organizationally, the Company implemented a modified leadership plan in 1980, electing Larkin Teasley as President and Chief Operating Officer of GSM, with Ivan J. Houston assuming the title of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. </p><p>The following decade saw the retirement of Ivan J. Houston as CEO on December 31, 1990 and Larkin Teasley's election as CEO on January 1, 1991. The new millennium brought forth a 75th year anniversary celebration, a time capsule sealed for over 50 years was opened and a new one encapsulated. Ivan J. Houston retired as Chairman of the Board on March 5, 2001 and Larkin Teasley was elected the new Chairman on the same date. Golden State Mutual closed its doors in 2009 after 84 years of operation.</p>  </bioghist>

During this period, he assisted in bringing the first suit filed in the South to permit Negroes to vote in primary elections. He moved to California in 1921 to supervise expansion of American Mutual but soon after, the firm discontinued its California operations. In Los Angeles, Nickerson joined forces with George A.

When he was twelve, he moved with his family to Los Angeles where he received an education at Los Angeles High School and the University of California, Los Angeles. He became an active member of the First A.M.E. Church on Eighth and Towne and started work with William Nickerson, Jr. in 1922 as an agent for the American Mutual Benefit Association. Beavers joined Norman O. Houston in 1924 to assist Nickerson with the foundation of the Golden State Guarantee Fund Insurance Company. When the doors of its one room office opened in 1925, Beavers' sister, Helen Hodge Batiste became the Company's first clerk and later, first female senior officer and member of its Board of Directors. George Beavers, Jr. served Golden State as its Vice President and Director of Agencies from 1925-1945 and then served as its Chairman of the Board until his retirement on October 25, 1966. As a civil servant, Beavers served as Commissioner of the Los Angeles Housing Authority from 1946 to 1962 and as a civil rights advocate, Beavers was a lifetime member of the NAACP, President and Director of the Los Angeles Urban League and Chairman of the State Commission on Equal Opportunities in Education. Additionally, in 1942, as President of Allied Organizations Against Discrimination in National Defense, Beavers led a campaign that opened the doors of war industries to Negro workers on the Pacific Coast. Beavers died in Los Angeles on October 12, 1989.</p></bioghist><c03 id="aspace_ref515_ow3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Charter Membership Contest</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1925</unitdate><container id="aspace_a12667e249d55c0cb6806eabb4506f30" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_7152c3122c225f1ee84d7ad2ccaa695e" parent="aspace_a12667e249d55c0cb6806eabb4506f30" type="folder">4</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_bd2992e8ce999030b801fb3ce562d1cd"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This document records Beavers as the winner.</p></scopecontent></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref517_3zj" level="file"><did><unittitle>Sermon </unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1925 May 17</unitdate><container id="aspace_3425ebbd546116f830c33326df37b501" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_f430ab487f6ab53d66e9e11104dc5709" parent="aspace_3425ebbd546116f830c33326df37b501" type="folder">5</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_cfc46a2721ff264b42364fcc0cf912c3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Copy of a sermon delivered by the late Reverend N.P.

Houston was born on October 16, 1893 in San Jose, California. He served in the United States Army from 1917 to 1919. He returned to the United States, became a licensed insurance broker in Los Angeles and worked with William Nickerson, Jr. as first representative and superintendent of the American Mutual Benefit Association of California. He resigned from American Mutual to help organize the Liberty Building Loan Association where he became field manager. He then left Liberty to become co-organizer of the Golden State Guarantee Fund Life Insurance Company with George A. Beavers, Jr. and Nickerson. Houston served Golden State from 1925-1945 as Secretary-Treasurer. He was elected President-Comptroller by the Board of Directors on the death of Founder William Nickerson, Jr. in 1945. He worked in this dual capacity until 1949 when the Comptroller title was removed and he served as President and Chief Executive Officer. In 1967 he became Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer until his retirement in 1977. Houston served numerous civic organizations such as the NAACP, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Assistance, the California State Athletic Commission, the Los Angeles Chapter of the American Red Cross and the 28th Street YMCA. Four days after his 88th birthday, Norman O. Houston died in Los Angeles on October 20, 1981.</p></bioghist><c03 id="aspace_ref558_d3c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Actuarial Department</unittitle><container id="aspace_9404a512f356cc2cbdd575e073ebe4ba" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">4</container><container id="aspace_05e0d3e84e1bb6d66d590a77b6f3164e" parent="aspace_9404a512f356cc2cbdd575e073ebe4ba" type="folder">2</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref556_kzd" level="file"><did><unittitle>A.M.E.

She won freedom for herself and her three daughters in a Los Angeles court room on January 19, 1856. Once free, she worked as a midwife and nurse for Dr. John Griffin, a Los Angeles physician. When she had saved enough money in 1865, she bought four large lots in the block between Spring and Broadway and Fourth and Third Streets. It was in Biddy Mason's home on Spring Street between 3rd and 4th where the first Black church in Los Angeles, now the First African Methodist Episcopal (A.M.E.) Church, was organized in 1872.

Upton at his offices in Burbank. Nickerson explained that he wanted to form an old line legal reserve life insurance company but could not do it on the capital stock plan because it took too much money. They discussed raising money by subscription and Upton suggested using the term Contribution Certificates. There was no law in California for or against securities of this name. Nickerson thought the name "as good as any" and they decided upon the wording of the Contribution Certificates that night. "These Contribution Certificates were to be issued in denominations of $50," wrote Nickerson. According to the Company's definition, "A Certificate of Contribution is an instrument evidencing a contingent promise to repay the original contribution out of corporate earnings. They are not regarded as a commercially salable security." </p><p>Norman O. Houston was responsible for selling the Certificates during the Company's organization efforts. The Company sold Certificates of Contribution again in 1925, 1938, 1940 and 1970. Members of the Board of Directors, Officers, Employees and Policyowners living in the State of California were allowed to purchase Certificates of Contribution. The sale of Certificates of Contribution in 1970 boosted the Company's surplus to more than $3 million for the first time in history. </p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_ee13784577db4e93d84a3031f30bc07f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In addition to Certificates of Contribution samples, the files include correspondence, applications to the California State Insurance Commissioner to offer and sell Certificates of Contribution and administrative procedures concerning the sales.

Houston, organizers of the Golden State Guarantee Fund Insurance Company, decided to sell Certificates of Advancement to meet the required $15,000 deposit with the state treasurer as a guarantee fund. Norman O. Houston sold Certificates of Advancement which promised liberal interest and gave the Company the right to redeem them whenever its surplus became sufficient. In 1938 the Company initiated its drive to convert its legal status from an assessment company to an old line legal reserve. The conversion meant that the Company had to deposit $250,000 in bonds with the state treasurer. The Golden State Board of Directors elected to employ the sale of Certificates of Advancement again to raise the required deposit.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_bd60a292bc573572ef728c8dc35e0795"><head>Scope and Content</head><p>Box 205: Materials include correspondence with legal counsel, Walter A.

The research that forms the basis of selection of the mural subjects was done by librarian Miriam Matthews and historian Titus Alexander. Woodruff and Alston traveled to California in August of 1948 for a research tour wherein they visited historical sites, examined records in libraries and museums, and filled sketchbooks with drawings of native rocks, flowers, terrain, costumes, art and equipment. Following the tour, a conference was held with the researchers and company officials to select the mural subjects. Each artist chose the period he would portray in his panel. Mr. Alston selected "exploration and colonization" and Mr. Woodruff, "settlement and development." The artists worked closely with Architect Paul R. Williams to have the color and style of the murals in harmony with the architecture and decorative design of the building. The murals, unveiled during the opening week ceremonies for GSM's new Home Office on August 19, 1949, cover two panels, 16' 5" by 9' 3 1/4" and hang on opposite walls of the building's lobby. Father H. Randolph Moore delivered the invocation for the mural unveiling ceremony and Titus Alexander served as Master of Ceremonies. Mrs. Charlotta Bass, publisher of the <title render="italic">California Eagle</title>, pulled the cord to unveil the Charles Alston mural and Mrs. Gussie Woods, mother of Hale Woodruff, pulled the cord to unveil the Woodruff mural.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_3ff34db1b71265f5317c2c3f10647dc0"><head>Scope and Content</head><p>Materials include source files on the murals, transcripts from an Executive Committee Conference with the mural artists, correspondence with the artists and architect Paul R.
