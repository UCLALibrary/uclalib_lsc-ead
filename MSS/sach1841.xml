    <head>Biography/History</head>
<p>William Lewis Sachtleben was an American long-distance cyclist who rode across Asia from Istanbul to Peking in 1891 to 1892 with Thomas Gaskell Allen Jr., his classmate from Washington University. Their journey had actually begun the day after they graduated from college, when they travelled to New York and on to Liverpool. In all they travelled 15,044 miles by bicycle, "the longest continuous land journey ever made around the world" as reported in their book Across Asia on a bicycle (1895). </p><p>On Wednesday, October 30, 1895, Armenians were massacred in Erzurum and the surrounding Armenian villages. American journalist William Sachtleben happened to be in Erzurum at that time, investigating the disappearance of American cyclist Frank Lenz. During the massacre Sachtleben was in the American mission building, where over 200 Armenians fled for protection. Sachtleben witnessed the aftermath of the massacre; he took photographs of the victims in the Armenian Cemetery and wrote three lengthy and detailed letters about the massacre that were published, unsigned and attributed to an Occasional Correspondent, in the London Times on November 16, 27 and December 9.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>This collection consists of photographs taken in 1891 covering William Lewis Sachtleben and Thomas Gaskell Allen Jr.'s winter stay in Athens and part of the journey that followed from Istanbul to Tashkent. The circular format photographs were taken with a Kodak box camera which was one of the first cameras available to amateur photographers (the Kodak, the No. 1, or the No. 2). Folder 5 and 7 of this collection include Sachtleben's photographs of the aftermath of the October 30, 1895 Armenian massacre in Erzurum.</p>  </scopecontent>
