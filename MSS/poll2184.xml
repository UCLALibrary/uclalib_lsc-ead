            <head>Biography/History</head>
            <p>Melvin Pollner was born on October 13, 1940, in the Bronx neighborhood of New York City. He attended the Bronx High School of Science and earned a bachelor's degree in sociology from the City College of New York. He went on to earn a master's degree in sociology from UC Berkeley and a PhD in sociology from UC Santa Barbara. He joined the UCLA Department of Sociology in 1968 where he taught for nearly 40 years.</p>
            <p>In the early 1980s, as part of the reorganization of the Department’s graduate program, faculty organized themselves into areas of common interest. One of these areas focused on ethnomethodological, phenomenological and observational sociologies (EPOS) and included the following professors as affiliated faculty: Melvin Pollner, Harold Garfinkel, Robert Emerson, Jack Katz and Emanuel Schegloff. Pollner taught Sociology 271, one of the introductory courses in this area that grappled with fundamental ideas and concerns which animate ethnomethodological and phenomenological investigations. Pollner’s course featured guest presentations by the aforementioned faculty and included topics such as “The world of everyday life and the problem of rationality,” “Rules, norms and tacit knowledge” and “Speaking and discourse.”</p>
            <p>Professor Pollner's primary research interests were the sociology of mental illness; self and identity; ethnomethodology; and toward the end of his career, economic sociology. His work in these areas included studies of psychiatric emergency teams, the construction of reality in families, making and managing meaning in traffic court, the impact of religious beliefs on psychological well-being, and narrative practices in Alcoholics Anonymous.</p>
            <p>UCLA Department of Sociology colleague and longtime collaborator, Professor Emeritus Robert Emerson described Pollner as deeply committed to sociology and specifically to ethnomethodology. Emerson remembers that Pollner described ethnomethodology as follows: “The study of the practices used to craft whatever participants in particular settings recognize as intelligible, meaningful and real.” According to Emerson, this meant “understanding all social matters -- gender and social class, reality and truth -- not as fixed objects or facts, but as meanings people create and sustain in interaction with one another.”</p>
            <p>Melvin Pollner died at the UCLA Medical Center on November 2, 2007. The Melvin Pollner Prize in Ethnomethodology was created in 2009 and awarded every other year beginning in 2010 to the author of an article, chapter or book that develops original work resonant with Pollner’s interests in topics such as mundane reason, reality disjunctures, radical reflexivity and the connections and contributions of ethnomethodology to other types of sociology.</p>
