    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>The collection contains approximately 500 black and white photographs taken ca. 1945-1946 in Japan and the Philippines. The photographs document the destruction caused by the atomic bomb in Nagasaki including the ruins of the Urakami Cathedral. Along with significant photographs depicting building destruction, many images depict Japanese citizens clearing rubble, living in the streets in makeshift camps, or moving bundled belongings by any means available. The photographs also include images of ruined Japanese boats, ships, and military planes. A few photographs depict crowds at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo as well as kabuki theatre. The collection also contains photographs of US GIs serving in Japan. Photographs from the Philippines focus on images of citizens living in rough and meager conditions.</p>  </scopecontent>
