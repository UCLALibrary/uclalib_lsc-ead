    <head>Biography</head>
<p>Mary Benson was born on December 9, 1919 in Pretoria, South Africa. She attended school in Australia. After her studies, she became secretary with British High Commission in Pretoria, South Africa from 1940 to 1941. She worked with the film director David Lean in London from 1947 to 1949. Subsequently she became the co-founder and secretary of Africa Bureau, London from the years 1950 to 1957. Benson lobbied in England and at the United Nations on South African issues and was active in the African Development Trust and National Campaign for the Abolition of Capital Punishment. She was also a known activist against apartheid. Benson left South Africa and became a political exile in London in 1966. Her publications include <title>Tshekedi Khama</title> (1960), <title>Chief Albert Lutuli of South Africa</title> (1963), <title>The African patriots: the story of the African National Congress of South Africa</title> (1963), <title>At the still point</title> (1970), and <title>Nelson Mandala</title> (1980).</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>A collection of anti-apartheid activist Mary Benson's research notes covering a wide array of politically related topics from the 1940s through the 1960s pertaining to African and South African government, civics, activists, and politicians. The formation and delegation of the African National Congress is a central theme among the various topics. With the exception of the notes found in the notebooks, most of the collection materials were typeset and include extensive annotations written throughout the body of the works. The notes also include Benson's personal remarks and opinions on various African political figures, and the annotations indicate sections from the notes that were ultimately disregarded, potentially drawn upon, or wholly included in her subsequent publications.</p>  </scopecontent>
