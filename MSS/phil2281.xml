    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>In the 1980s, Philippine zine culture first emerged, as a result of music fan zines that were introduced at the same time punk music was being introduced in the country. Contemporarily, the content of the zines Filpinos produce have expanded to explore different themes such as personal, political, cultural, literary, art, feminism, and more. The zine culture flourished in the 2000s due to the emergence of the digital age that allowed artists to post their zines on different platforms. Zine culture, however, was catalyzed by the emergence of a small press conference called <title>Better Living Through Xeroxography (BLTX)</title>. This press conference was founded on empowering artists through the highlighting of problems in mainstream publishing and introducing self-publication as a solution. <title>BLTX</title> was able take the discontent over mainstream publishing and push for a way to educate and mobilize to address it through artistic means.</p>  </bioghist>

adult-oriented comics that contain graphic nudity and sexual themes.

This photozine contains screencaps from erotic/pornographic films: 'Barbara Broadcast', 'Behind the Green Door', 'Beyond Shame', 'Devil in Miss Jones', 'Erotic Night of the Livign Dead', 'Erotikill', 'Itallian Stallion', 'Space Thing', 'Story of O', and 'Talk Dirty to me'. Despite the mature source of the images, the photozine only includes a couple of explicit images, and primarily focuses on shots that showcase the characters in their homes.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Sexuality</subject><subject source="local">Screencaps</subject><subject authfilenumber="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85007461" source="lcsh">Art</subject><subject authfilenumber="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85034755" source="lcsh">Culture</subject><subject authfilenumber="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85088043" source="lcsh">Film</subject></controlaccess></c01><c01 id="aspace_a355b3737cf58f7af31f6dd2e32dc05f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Hourly Comic Day: Birthday Edition</unittitle><origination label="Creator"><persname source="ingest">Custodio, Gioseppe</persname></origination><unitdate datechar="publication" normal="2017/2017">2017</unitdate><container id="aspace_17cca9a5677e29c0dffc9fb15e16fb36" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">4</container><container id="aspace_4aeb51cccacaa846a07865d41e3155d6" parent="aspace_17cca9a5677e29c0dffc9fb15e16fb36" type="folder">7</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_6e56f2395c5b8610594a4009c9958ef2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Gioseppe Custodio makes a comic for every hour on the day of his birthday.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Hourly Comic Day</subject><subject authfilenumber="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85007461" source="lcsh">Art</subject></controlaccess></c01><c01 id="aspace_e81bf579dfd6dc2ec0be1bdca8f40033" level="file"><did><unittitle>Humigit-Kumulang</unittitle><origination label="Creator"><persname source="ingest">Liboon, Franz Joel</persname></origination><origination label="Creator"><corpname role="pbl" source="ingest">High Chair</corpname></origination><unitdate datechar="publication" normal="2013/2013">2013</unitdate><container id="aspace_4512c5e90236a576eb5787dbd7f7e847" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">4</container><container id="aspace_a3bca8f8ee386ecc41d780d5b2d5bd0f" parent="aspace_4512c5e90236a576eb5787dbd7f7e847" type="folder">8</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_26b819a3dc1c3cb58be216e02041b94b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>A poetry book in Filipino that surrounds the idea of being too much and not enough.

Drunken ideas of how to salvage the people of the Philippines from poverty are suggested by the poet, all of which the other person denies doing because he believes the revolution is not going to be catalyzed by one person, but rather, the Masa or the People. The poems go on to describe the fray that is Manila, and wonder, how can they still feel love for this person despite being in the midst of collective despair?</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject authfilenumber="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh94002193" source="lcsh">Corruption</subject><subject authfilenumber="http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/graphicMaterials/tgm005493" source="gmgpc">Intoxication</subject><subject authfilenumber="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85123969" source="lcsh">Social Justice </subject><subject authfilenumber="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85034755" source="lcsh">Culture</subject><subject authfilenumber="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85077507" source="lcsh">Literature</subject><subject authfilenumber="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh2002011436" source="lcsh">Politics</subject></controlaccess></c01><c01 id="aspace_1d8037abda0a101c2d3e9046c7aa7100" level="file"><did><unittitle>Metallic Carcass</unittitle><origination label="Creator"><persname source="ingest">Padiernos, Alperr</persname></origination><unitdate datechar="publication" normal="2017/2017">2017</unitdate><container id="aspace_a82240b6e7adcfe73fd2adad88fae5ee" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">5</container><container id="aspace_83af002a3b8259899613dfba0cb1c24a" parent="aspace_a82240b6e7adcfe73fd2adad88fae5ee" type="folder">16</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_263a00b3a8ce01a7c4a23ca0c4602b35"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This photozine contains a series of monochromatic photos of Alperr's daily traverse that highlights the beauty, despite the stress and hardship, of riding the public transit.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><genreform source="local">Photography</genreform><subject authfilenumber="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh2006005051" source="lcsh">Monochrome</subject><subject authfilenumber="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85128595" source="lcsh">Light rail transit</subject><subject authfilenumber="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85007461" source="lcsh">Art</subject><subject authfilenumber="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85137027" source="lcsh">Transportation</subject></controlaccess></c01><c01 id="aspace_4812e9ade9092c191baea537b42064ae" level="file"><did><unittitle>Mga Huling Habilin Ni Nikolas</unittitle><origination label="Creator"><persname source="ingest">Flores, Catherine A.</persname></origination><unitdate datechar="publication">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_66e0d2fa659b22af44bfee00f3a36852" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">5</container><container id="aspace_54457fd2f69cf83db8d11fc377d785eb" parent="aspace_66e0d2fa659b22af44bfee00f3a36852" type="folder">17</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_7cee1c9ae6d9f6a6513331ea3767b353"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>These poems and flash stories are Nikolas' last will and testament.
