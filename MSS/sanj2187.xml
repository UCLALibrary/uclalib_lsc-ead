    <head>Biography/History</head>
<p>Avedis K. Sanjian was born on February 24, 1921 in Marash, Turkey. After spending years in Armenian refugee camps in Syria and Lebanon, the Sanjians moved to Palestine in 1926, and three years later settled in the Armenian Quarter of Jerusalem, where he grew up. Sanjian earned two degrees in English: a bachelor's degree from the American University of Beirut in 1949 and a master's degree from the University of Michigan in 1950. He married Helen Karaghuzian in 1950 and they had their son Gregory in 1952. Four years later he became the first graduate student at Michigan to receive a doctorate in Near Eastern Studies. </p><p>Sanjian's academic career began in 1957 with an appointment at Harvard University's Center for Middle Eastern Studies as a postdoctoral research fellow in Armenian studies. He was appointed assistant professor of Armenian studies at Harvard University in 1961, the first time full-time Armenian studies appointment in the United States. At Harvard, Sanjian developed the first curriculum of Armenological courses in the U.S. and compiled <title render="italic">A Grammar of Classical Armenian</title> to enable others to learn this language. </p><p>Sanjian left Harvard when the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) invited him to join its faculty in 1965 as associate professor of Armenian studies. Three years later he was promoted to the rank of full professor, and in 1969 he was appointed to the first ever endowed chair at UCLA, the Chair for Armenian Studies. At his suggestion in 1979, the Chair was named after medieval Armenian mystic poet Grigor Narekatsi. Also in 1969, he inaugurated UCLA's graduate program in Armenian studies.</p><p>From 1970 to 1974, Sanjian served as Chairman of the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures, which had four undergraduate and seven graduate degree programs. During this time he was also working on his opus, <title render="italic">A Catalogue of Medieval Armenian Manuscripts in the United States</title>, a descriptive and analytical study of all Armenian manuscripts housed in the United States with the exception of the UCLA collection for which he prepared a separate catalogue, <title render="italic">Medieval Armenian Manuscripts at the University of California, Los Angeles</title> (Z6621.U65963 A76 1999). Sanjian finalized negotiations for UCLA's acquisition of this collection with Dr. Caro Minasian and hand-delivered its most valuable item, the manuscript of the Four Gospels executed at the Armenian monastery of Glajor.</p><p>Sanjian wrote ten books and authored more than 40 articles in English and Armenian. He is a founding member of the Society for Armenian Studies (SAS), served as its chairman on three occasions and as editor-in-chief of its publication, the <title render="italic">Journal of the Society for Armenian Studies</title> (JSAS). He also served as a board member for the National Association for Armenian Studies and Research (NAASR) and provided testimony on the Armenian genocide before the United States Congress Subcommittee on Future Foreign Policy Research and Development on May 11, 1976.</p><p>Sanjian, UCLA Professor of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures, Emeritus, died at the age of 74 on July 22, 1995.</p>  </bioghist>
