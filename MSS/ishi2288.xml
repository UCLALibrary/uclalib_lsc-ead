    <head>Biography/History</head>
<p>Eiko Ishioka was born on July 12, 1938 in Tokyo, Japan and attended the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music, studying in the Design Department of the Faculty of Fine Arts. She graduated in 1961, and started her career designing advertising campaigns for the Japanese cosmetics giant Shiseido. In 1970, Ishioka founded her own design firm and soon diversified her work by adding books and journals (including those published by Kadokawa Books), magazine articles, record album covers, and product packaging to her repertoire, as well as serving as stage director of several Issey Miyake fashion shows. Her firm also created numerous advertising campaigns for major clients such as the department store chain Parco throughout the 1970s. </p><p>Ishioka soon branched out into the performing arts, and she spent the last several decades of her career mainly designing costumes and/or sets for theater, film, opera, and individual performers. Some of her major stage credits include the Broadway productions <title render="italic">M. Butterfly</title> (1988) and <title render="italic">David Copperfield's Dreams &amp; Nightmares</title> (1996); the Nederlander Opera's <title render="italic">The Ring of Nibelung</title> (1997-1998); Cirque du Soleil's <title render="italic">Varekai</title> (2002); and singer Grace Jones' <title render="italic">Hurricane</title> tour (2009). Film credits include production work for Paul Schrader's <title render="italic">Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters</title> (1985) and costumes designed for a number of Tarsem (Tarsem Singh) films, as well as for Francis Ford Coppola's <title render="italic">Bram Stoker's Dracula</title> (1992), which garnered her an Oscar. In addition, Ishioka curated exhibitions, including the photography exhibitions <title render="italic">Nuba</title> (1980) and <title render="italic">Life</title> (1992) regarding the work of German filmmaker and photographer Leni Riefenstahl, and she contributed to the multi-media art installation <title render="italic">Tokyo: Form &amp; Spirit</title> (1986). She also designed sports uniforms for the NBA and Olympic athletes. Along with these various endeavors, Ishioka continued with advertising work, and with book and record cover design, including the Grammy-winning cover of Miles Davis' <title render="italic">Tutu</title> (1986). She compiled and designed two books that focused on her career: <title render="italic">Eiko by Eiko</title> (1983) and <title render="italic">Eiko on Stage</title> (2000). </p><p>Eiko Ishioka was married to Nico Soultanakis. She died on January 21, 2012, in Tokyo, Japan. </p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>Material in the Eiko Ishioka papers relates to nearly every aspect of the designer's multi-faceted career. Her work in the performing arts is documented through costume drawings and sketches, set design drawings, research material, production records and photographs, fabric samples, and audiovisual material for numerous stage projects, including the Broadway productions <title render="italic"> M. Butterfly</title> (1988) and <title render="italic">David Copperfield: Dreams &amp; Nightmares</title> (1996), the operas <title render="italic">Chushingura</title> (1997) and <title render="italic">The Ring of the Nibelung</title> (1997-1998), and Cirque du Soleil's <title render="italic"> Varekai </title> (2002). Although this collection holds little material relating to her work in film, it does contain original costume design drawings and sketches for <title render="italic">Bram Stoker's Dracula</title> (1992), as well as several posters designed by Ishioka for the Japanese releases of that film, <title render="italic">Apocalypse Now</title>, and others. In addition, the collection documents other varied projects including the curation of exhibitions dedicated to the life and work of Leni Riefenstahl, <title render="italic">Nuba</title> (1980) and <title render="italic">Life</title> (1992); posters designed for inclusion in or as advertising for numerous exhibitions; and several collaborations with fashion designer Issey Miyake in the 1970s. </p><p>This collection also documents Ishioka's design of books, particularly <title render="italic">Eiko by Eiko</title> (1983);  journals, including <title render="italic">Wild Times</title>, and magazine articles; record album covers, especially Miles Davis' <title render="italic">Tutu</title>; and products and packaging, through production material such as photographs, drawings, layouts, and proofs, as well as final products. A small amount of material pertains to her work designing athletic uniforms, including for the Houston Rockets NBA team, the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, and costumes for the opening ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. </p><p>Ishioka's decades-long career in advertising is well-represented in this collection through numerous posters, photographs, slides, transparencies, digital, and audiovisual items, primarily for campaigns designed for the Japanese companies Shiseido, Parco, Kadokawa Books, Diana shoes, Kissa, Tokyu, Sanyo Fashion House, and others from the 1960s-1980s. </p><p>The collection contains numerous items created while Ishioka was a student at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music, including artwork (drawings, sketches, paintings) and production material pertaining to design projects, as well as snapshots of various excursions and activities during this time period. In addition, material documenting her overall career through photographs, portfolios, awards, publicity, and art supplies, is also present. Finally, the collection contains Ishioka's voluminous library of art, design, and other books.</p>  </scopecontent>

Many of the files are selections of images of her various works for <title>Eiko on Stage</title> and <title>Eiko by Eiko</title>, as well as design elements for the two books.
