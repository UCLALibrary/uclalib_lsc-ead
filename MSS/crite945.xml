    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>The prints were made by Cal Williams Photo Service, using the author's own family photographs, and possibly photos from other sources such as local historical societies and libraries. Family photographs include portraits of the author's parents--his father, Angus McCloud Crites, his mother, Louisa Maria Jewett of Weybridge, Vermont, as well as the author as a young man in uniform during the Spanish-American War in 1898, and his two brothers, Angus, and George. Several photographs show the early homestead on Bear Mountain, near Bakersfield, where the family lived in the late 1880s and 1890s, the Keene School which the author attended as a young boy (1890), and the Kern County High School class of 1893. There is also an early photo of the Kern County Courthouse from 1888. Many of the photos describe the surrounding rugged landscape of the High Sierra, highlighting Upper and Lower Kern Lake, and Golden Trout Creek, and Mt. Whitney. Other early photos of towns nearby include a grain thresher in Weed Patch, Calif., the old school house in Tehachapi, and Main Street in the town of Havilah in the 1880s. After his discharge from the army in 1898, Crites went to work as a bookkeeper on the Bellevue cattle ranch, 8 miles west of Bakersfield, and there are several photos of ranching scenes, and the ranch headquarters. Also included are photographs documenting life of the Indians of Kern County, such as an Indian woman collecting salt grass for basket-weaving, Indian farmers, and Indian petroglyphs found on basaltic rocks near Black Mountain in northeastern Kern County. Several photographs show old Fort Tejon and the guardhouse.</p>  </scopecontent>
