    <head>Expanded Biographical Note</head>
<p>Paul Friedländer (born, Berlin, March 21, 1882; died, Los Angeles, December 10, 1968) was amongst the most eminent of UCLA's Professors of Classics.</p><p>Friedländer was the son of Maximilian Friedländer, a businessman, and Clara Schidlower. In Germany, his instructors included some of the principal classical scholars of the time, notably Franz Buecheler, Wilhelm Schulze, Hermann Usener and Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff.</p><p>During World War 1, Friedländer served at the front and became one of the few Jewish officers in the German army. He was awarded the Iron Cross for heroism and, in 1918, returned to Berlin. During the war, Friedländer had been made Extraordinarius in the University of Berlin: in 1920, he was appointed full professor (Ordinarius) of Classical Philology at Marburg. Here, he joined the circle of Rudolf Bultmann, Ernst Robert Curtius, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Martin Heidegger and Leo Spitzer. In the same year he married Charlotte (<emph render="italic">née</emph> Friedländer).</p><p>In 1932, Paul Friedländer moved to the University at Halle. Three years later, because he was Jewish, the authorities removed him from his chair and, in 1938, imprisoned him for six weeks in the concentration camp Sachsenhausen. Bultmann arranged for his release and, in 1939, Friedländer with his wife and daughter were permitted to emigrate.</p><p>In the United States, Friedländer taught briefly at the Johns Hopkins University and, in 1940, at the age of 58, was appointed to an assistant professorship at UCLA. Five years later, he became full professor at UCLA and, after another four years, retired and was made emeritus.<emph render="super">1</emph> In 1968, Friedländer died.</p><p>In 1973 and 1974, Friedländer's widow disposed of her husband's books and papers. The books included monographs, periodicals, and offprints.</p><p>Friedländer's colleagues at UCLA were given opportunity to acquire books from his library. It was at this time that Herbert Hoffleit, whose library was later sold through the antiquarian market, obtained books from Friedländer's shelves. For the rest, most of the periodicals were discarded; the bulk of the collection of offprints was given to the Department of Classics, UCLA; the correspondence, manuscripts, and some books and offprints were presented to the Gifts department in the University Research Library, UCLA; and the rest of the library was donated to the University of California, Irvine.</p><p>UCLA Gifts offered their holdings to the Department of Special Collections, and these materials were mostly boxed and put into storage. Possibly at this time, one book was catalogued and introduced into the rare books stacks (<title>Q. Horati Flacci de arte poetica epistola ad Pisones</title>, s. 1. 1919: PA 6393 E6 1919), whilst at least one other was added to the main stacks. Some miscellaneous manuscripts and printed materials were placed in the Special Collections general manuscript file. To this file were added such other materials as afterwards were donated to the Department or chanced to be discovered: e.g., two letters from Friedländer to Carey (donated by W.M. Calder III in 1986).</p><p>1. For Friedländer, see his <title>Argolica</title>, Diss. inaug. Berlin 1905, p.96; W.M. Calder III in <title>The Dictionary of North American Classicists</title> ed. Ward W. Briggs Jr., (forthcoming), s.u.</p><p>In 1990, these miscellaneous materials were assigned the Collection number 1551 and, in the following year, the original donation in storage was introduced into this collection. Also in 1991, the Department of Classics, having decided to dispose of their holdings, donated two large groups of materials to Archives, whence it was transferred to Collection 1551. Much however still remained in the Classics Department. Some of the other materials were offered to staff, students and visitors. One individual donated the offprints he had selected. Then, the remainder, together with Five large boxes of manuscripts and offprints, was transferred to Special Collections.</p><p>In May 1992, the Chairman of Classics added an interesting letter to Friedländer from Walther Kranz (July 19, 1950); in August 1992, the original Thomas Mann materials were introduced; and in January 1993, an envelope with two photographs of Walther Kranz and a note from Paul Lindemann were found and added.<emph render="super">2</emph> </p>  </bioghist>

Many of the summaries were prepared for Friedländer by Bertha Stenzel (see e.g. Summaries of Scholarship IV G: Gauss and Vlastos). The materials have been left essentially in the order in which they were received: as individuals interested in the summarised works will naturally consult the originals, so the summations should interest those primarily interested in Friedländer. These summaries are mostly in alphabetical sequence: it is to be emphasised, however, that it is not always so. Thus, works by Werner Jaeger in Summaries of Scholarship III are found both in "C" and "J." Further, it is to be noted that Friedländer mixed some works together. Finally, letters from scholars, chiefly Bertha Stenzel, have been removed to the Correspondence file, where their original source is signalled.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref1048_ne0" level="subseries" score="1" C-ORDER="656"><did><unittitle>Plato Manuscript.
