    <head>Biography</head>
<p>Joseph Lionel Fainer was born in 1897 in California. He graduated from the University of California at Berkeley and practiced criminal law in San Francisco and Oakland before coming to Los Angeles in 1927. He spent the rest of his life in Southern California and died on August 21, 1960 in San Marino.</p><p>Fainer is most notable for serving as special prosecutor in <title>People vs. Kynette, Allen, and Browne</title>. This court case led to the eventual recall of Los Angeles Mayor Frank Shaw. From its earliest days, many Shaw opponents suspected his administration of corruption. Anti-Shaw forces hired Harry Raymond to investigate the administration. On January 14, 1938, Raymond's car exploded, severely injuring the detective and bringing corruption allegations to a head when it was discovered that Earle Kynette, a Los Angeles Police Captain, had planted the bomb. Both Roy Allen and Kynette were convicted and public outcry over the scandal led to the recall election.</p>  </bioghist>
