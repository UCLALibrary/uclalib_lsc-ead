    <head>Biography/History</head>
<p>Al Hayman was born in 1847 in Wheeling, West Virginia. In 1882, he began his career as a theatrical manager when he began managing the Bush Theatre in San Francisco. Hayman produced many successful plays and purchased or managed other theaters. In 1886, he partnered with Charles Frohman to start a booking agency providing Western US theatres with entertainment and venues provided by Frohman entertainment companies. This partnership was later attributed to the beginning of the theatre monopoly known as The Syndicate, which dominated theatre bookings in the United States from 1896 to the early 1900s. Hayman is credited with the building and the success of the Empire Theatre in New York, which opened in 1893. He was also instrumental in carrying out Louis Aldrich's dream of building a home for retired actors, The Actors' Fund Home on Staten Island. He served as president of The Actors' Fund and was a member of the Players' Club. Hayman died in 1917 in New York City.</p>  </bioghist>
