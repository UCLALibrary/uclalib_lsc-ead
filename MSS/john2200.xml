Johnston documented and donated this collection of transcripts to the June L. Mazer Archives in order to insure the voices of "ordinary dykes" were included in the archives. As such these are ordinary conversations between women living in California, some of them lesbians who were out, and some who were not.</abstract>

<p>Michelle Johnston documented and donated this collection of transcripts to the Mazer Archives in order to ensure the voices of "ordinary dykes" were included in the archives. As such these are ordinary conversations between women living in California, some of them lesbians who were out, and some who were not. All conversations took place online and none of the correspondents knew one another in any other context.</p>  </bioghist>
