    <head>Biography/History</head>
<p>The author is a student at Oxford during the reign of James II. He is thus likely teenaged, and certainly male.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>The book is a miscellany written in a single hand. It appears that the pages in the volume were filled at different times (and in no particular order), but the bulk seems likely to have been between 1684 and 1686. Contents include accounts of the author's expenses while at Oxford University, including tutors and booksellers, clothes, shoes, handkerchiefs, foodstuffs, and his pocket money. It also contains a few short letters, verse and prose entries, the latter often in Latin, and a few acrostics/puzzles in both English and Latin. The author also seems to be taking Hebrew lessons, and occasionally practices his Hebrew characters. One section of the book is devoted to directions for drawing and painting, and on cleaning artwork as well as mixing chemicals and paints. This includes recipes for mixing paints of a wide variety of colors, often with somewhat whimsical names. Towards the end of the book is a section of Biblical studies.</p>  </scopecontent>
