    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The Pacific Photo Club was an organization of amateur photographers across the United States active from the early 1900s through at least the 1930s. In addition to U.S. photographers, some participants hailed from Japan, Australia, and other areas.</p><p>The collection was accumulated by George R. Bunn, who lived in Los Angeles and who appears to have been an active member of the photo club.</p><p>Members corresponded by mail, exchanging photographs and assembling annotated group albums. The club also organized trips, such as camping expeditions to Yellowstone and Palm Springs, during which they practiced their avocation, and later exchanged these photos.</p><p>The Pacific Photo Club was one of many such camera and photo societies that emerged at the beginning of the 20th century for amateur photographers seeking to enhance their technique and the artistic quality of their images. A number of the photographers in this collection had their work published in amateur photography magazines, including <title render="italic">Popular Photography</title> and <title render="italic">American Photography</title>, among them E. A. Doolittle, Arthur Van W. Eltinge, C. A. Heald, J. W. Jeffers, P. Benson Oakley, G. W. Schinkel, and Elizabeth B. Wotkyns.</p><p>Other similar titles from the era include <title render="italic">Anthony's Photographic Bulletin</title>, <title render="italic">The Photographic Times</title>, <title render="italic">The American Amateur Photographer</title>, <title render="italic">The Photo Beacon</title>, <title render="italic">Camera Notes</title>, <title render="italic">Camera and Darkroom</title>, <title render="italic">Photographic Topics</title>, and <title render="italic">Popular Photography</title>.</p><p>In addition to submitting photos for publication, and in some cases commentary, subscribers to these publications would post classified-style ads requesting exchange. For example, the following appeared in American Photography, Vol. 9 (January - December 1915):</p><p>"507. George R. Bunn. 1571 W. First St., Los Angeles, Calif. 3) 4 x 5Y2 prints, all kinds D. O. P. of California mountain and marine scenery to exchange for artistic scenery preferred."</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>The collection consists primarily of black-and-white photographs created by members of the Pacific Photo Club. The bulk of the images appear to have been taken by George R. Bunn. Also included are club correspondence, personal correspondence, newsletters, photographic postcards, and albums representing the work of members.</p><p>The majority of photographs were taken in the U.S., though some were shot in locations as far away as Japan, India, Australia, and Europe. Subjects include landscapes, people, street scenes, historic landmarks, civic events (e.g., parades, rodeos, car shows, and festivals), and artistic still lifes. The bulk of the subjects are nature related, with many photos of the American West, including national parks and forests. The images also provide insight into the fashions of the times, in particular women's hiking garb.</p><p>The albums compiled by members, with their attendant correspondence, document the procedures and function of this photo club.</p>  </scopecontent>

About two-thirds of them were kept by Bunn in individual envelopes, often labeled by subject or date. These grouped photos appeared to be primarily photos that Bunn had taken himself; apparently each envelope corresponded to a roll of film. In processing this collection, the grouped photographs were kept together in order to reflect their context and respect Bunn's original order of the collection.</p><p>About one third of the photographs were loose and not organized by subject or photographer. There were many photos by Bunn in this set, along with photos by many other club members, which suggests that these were chosen by participating club members for sharing with one another. Annotations on the back of some photos support this assumption. For example, some include a list of initials, crossed out, which corresponds with the club's practice of circulating photos among members for feedback. Since these loose photos apparently represent the club's activity (including Bunn's own selections), they were arranged separately from the rest of Bunn's photos.</p><p>The loose photographs have been arranged by photographer in alphabetical order, when the photographer could be identified. Photographs by unidentified photographers in Box 3 have been bundled together when related by subject or photographer's handwriting.</p></arrangement><c02 id="aspace_ref13_nu1" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries 1.1: Albums</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1917/1921" type="inclusive">Undated, 1917-1921</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_fa8dd6858033582ae9191e1297b73808"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>The club-related albums are three among what was presumably a much larger output, as evinced by their numbering. (Only numbers 6, 20, and 36 are in the collection.) The albums were produced by members of the club and circulated for comments by other contributors. The contributors' notes, in the form of a sewn sheaf of papers, are included in the folder. (See Scope and Content, Series 2.) The Japanese Souvenir Album consists of postcards from an unidentified source.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref14_ur5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Pacific Photo Club, Sequoia Album No. 6</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1917/1917" type="inclusive">1917</unitdate><container id="aspace_068f196b2c4306f69f099d4357feb831" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">6</container><container id="aspace_241d41dd134e4a6d63bdf619dcb0130d" parent="aspace_068f196b2c4306f69f099d4357feb831" type="folder">2</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref15_4h0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Pacific Photo Club, Sequoia Album No. 20</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1919/1919" type="inclusive">1919</unitdate><container id="aspace_bf30d1951246e4a8f99ca8dedf8dcf93" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">6</container><container id="aspace_010871466981e4ed85486ed065a3e80e" parent="aspace_bf30d1951246e4a8f99ca8dedf8dcf93" type="folder">3</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref16_ioz" level="file"><did><unittitle>Pacific Photo Club, Sequoia Album No. 36</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1921/1921" type="inclusive">1921</unitdate><container id="aspace_7fb2c8e2b17389e2dfbd924b074a204f" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">6</container><container id="aspace_24d67ecedf56a21d2765e940bb63dabc" parent="aspace_7fb2c8e2b17389e2dfbd924b074a204f" type="folder">4</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref18_dof" level="file"><did><unittitle>Japanese Souvenir Album</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1900/1955" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_e6ace974453b357bf62ea734712475b0" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">6</container><container id="aspace_91df063f8a5b1891f05066840e20c6b3" parent="aspace_e6ace974453b357bf62ea734712475b0" type="folder">5</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref19_5na" level="file"><did><unittitle>Alabama</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1900/1955" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_b230fb038e93b4c0f351d1aa7f4feb2b" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">6</container><container id="aspace_c148e841228b13eb89d0fa40b93b337a" parent="aspace_b230fb038e93b4c0f351d1aa7f4feb2b" type="folder">6</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref20_oqa" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bunn, George R.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1900/1955" type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_47f7545bcb86241982e6d1d9ce86370e" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">6</container><container id="aspace_40c26cfcb99bb59fa7cc5f14eac271aa" parent="aspace_47f7545bcb86241982e6d1d9ce86370e" type="folder">7</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref22_htl" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries 1.2: Loose photographs</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1908/1955" type="inclusive">1908-1955</unitdate><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1910/1920" type="bulk">1910-1920</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="aspace_64fbfe8aac636c72b7b1d6c815e32be9"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Note: Color images can be found in Box 2, Folder 6 (P.
