    <head>Biography/History</head>
<p>Italian engraver and photographer. After working as an apprentice with the engraver Achille Paris during the 1850s, Brogi turned to photography, and established his first studio in Florence in 1856. He produced a series of photographs of the Holy Land in 1862, and his catalogue of photographs of Florence and Tuscany appeared in 1878. The following year, in 1879, he began photographing the antiquities and mummies of Pompei. Brogi catered to the tourist trade, with shops in Florence, Rome, and Naples. He exhibited his work widely throughout Europe, and was named "Photographer of the Emperor" by Umberto I. After his death in 1881, Brogi's son, Carlo, with help from his brother Alfredo, continued to manage the firm.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>Views of Pisa (numbered 3300-3499), include the Camposanto, the exterior and interior of the Duomo and Battistero, the Campanile or Leaning Tower, the Church of Santa Maria della Spina, and the Ponte Solferino along the Arno River. In Florence, Brogi photographed the Church of Santa Croce, highlighting monuments to Michelangeo and Dante Alighieri, inside and outside, respectively, as well as the fountains and statuary of the Boboli Gardens, the Piazza della Signoria, Palazzo Vecchio, facade of the Duomo, a gallery in the Uffizi, a church cloister, and a panoramic view of the city. There are five photographs of the Certosa di Pavia, including the facade, the sculpture of the choir, and cloister. In Milan, Brogi has captured the Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie, the Gothic spires and facade of the cathedral, the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele, and the triumphal arch, Arco della Pace. Also included are several shots of the ruins of Pompeii: the amphitheater, Casa di Diomede, Casa del Poeta tragico, mosaic fountain in the Casa dell'Orso, and two photographs of the plaster mummies of Pompeii from the museum there. In Naples, we see the Palazzo Reale, Chiesa di San Francesco di Paola, Certosa di San Martino, Teatro San Carlo, various street and harbor scenes, the bay, the road leading up to Mt. Vesuvius, and Virgil's tomb. The album concludes with views of the Cha?teau de Fontainebleau, near Paris: the gardens, galleries, throne room, apartments of Louis XV, bedchambers of Napoleon I, and Marie Antoinette. Also included are photographs of many paintings, drawings, and sculptures from museums and galleries in Italy, by artists such as Fra Angelico, Correggio, G. Medrano, Pierre-Paul Prud'hon, Georges Rouget, and Jacques-Louis David.</p><p>Probable range of dates of photos based on Brogi's biographical information; cf. Encyclopedia of nineteenth-century photography / John Hannavy, ed. (New York: Routledge/Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2008). A few photos may have been produced later in the 1890s by Brogi's son, Carlo.</p>  </scopecontent>
