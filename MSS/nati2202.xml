<p>The National Lesbian Conference was the first and only of its kind, attempting to set a national lesbian activist agenda. The event took place in Atlanta, Georgia in 1991 and drew over 2,500 registered attendees. The gathering was comprised of one full day of caucuses, five plenaries, four mornings of anti-oppression training and slightly fewer than three hundred workshops. </p><p>The Conference became a concept after the American attendees at an international lesbian conference in 1986 felt that they had no unified voice due to a lack of national lesbian agenda. In 1988, a few American lesbians met in Washington D.C. to plan a national lesbian conference. Subsequently, planning meetings were held in North Carolina, Oregon, and Missouri. Meetings operated by modified consensus. Consensus and parity (defined as 50% lesbians of color, 20% disabled lesbians and 5% old lesbians) were of prime importance. The full steering committee, with over 100 seats to represent many different interest groups, was never fully seated. Although the ostensible goal of the conference was to decide collectively on a national lesbian agenda, the goal remained elusive. The conference became fertile ground for intra-organizational conversations about representation and the political process, but a fair amount of strife and dissent plagued much of the conversation. </p>  </bioghist>
