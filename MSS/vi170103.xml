    <head>Biography</head>
<p>Simeon A. Villa was born in Beata, Pandacan. He studied medicine at the University of Santo Tomas in the Philippines and ophthalmology in Japan before becoming involved in revolutionary activities. He served under General Daniel Tirona in 1898, and was accused of committing atrocities against the Spaniards, accusations he did little to deny. During the next year, he was on the personal staff of Lieutenant-General Antonio Luna. During Aguinaldo's flight from U.S. forces, Villa was part of the revolutionary leader's inner circle. After the capture of Aguinaldo, Villa fled to Japan to avoid imprisonment; he returned to the Philippines in 1902. Villa died in 1945. [Source: Aguinaldo's Odyssey; as told in the diaries of Col. Simeon Villa and Dr. Santiago Barcelona Manila: Publications of the Bureau of Public Libraries, 1963.]</p><p>Emilio Aguinaldo was born in Kawit, Cavite in 1869. He first came to national prominence by playing a central role in the 1896 Philippine uprising against Spain. After a short exile to Hong Kong in 1897, Aguinaldo returned to the Philippines, leading a Philippine insurrection that worked in concert with American forces during the Spanish-American War. During this time, he established the first Philippine Republic with its capital at Malolos and was elected president. At the conclusion of the Spanish-American War, Aguinaldo led a rebellion against the American occupying forces. The American pursuit in response to these actions is the cause of the flight described in Villa's diary. After his capture in 1901, Aguinaldo signed an oath of allegiance to the United States and served a short prison term. Aguinaldo died in 1964. (Source: Artemio R. Guillermo and May Kyi Win. <title>Historical Dictionary of the Philippines</title>. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 1997).</p><p>Nothing is known about the translator of the diary, identified only as J.C.H.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>This typewritten manuscript is a carbon copy of an English translation of the diary of Simeon A. Villa, one of the men who accompanied the Philippine revolutionary leader Emilio Aguinaldo as he attempted to flee from American soldiers in 1899-1901. Aguinaldo and his allies find themselves on the move almost constantly, as they travel from the western coast to the eastern coast of Northern Luzon. Much of the diary focuses on the climate, the topography, the lack of food, and rumors about American forces or hostile natives; however, Villa also discusses the dynamics of the Philippine Revolutionary Government and Igorot culture, with particular attention to the ka&amp;#x00F1;ao. It also includes a short biography of Aguinaldo and many references to Villa, Tanio, and other key figures in the revolutionary movement. The diary includes a discussion of the Philippine understanding of American politics, especially as they concern President McKinley. The translator, "J.C.H." has added a number of explanatory notes that seem directed to those unfamiliar with the history and culture of the Philippines, as well as commentary on the original manuscript. The diary ends on March 22, 1901, the day before Aguinaldo, Villa, and the rest of their party were captured by American forces in Palanan.</p><p>A certificate has been bound with the typescript. This document, written in both Tagalog and Spanish, appears to be an official document produced by the Revolutionary Government of the Philippines (Gobierno Revolucionario de Filipinas) that confers upon Mr. Canuto Aritao the rank of First Lieutenant of the Infantry Reserve. It is dated December 13, 1898, eleven months before Villa's diary begins. The name "Canuto Aritao" does not appear in Villa's diary. The certificate appears in front of the typescript.</p>  </scopecontent>
