<p>Todd McKay may have been born Mansell McKalip. Around 1937, he appears to have moved from Tarentum, PA, near Pittsburgh, to Los Angeles. He composed music, though there is no evidence that any of it was recorded or published. He may have worked for Paramount Pictures for a time. He retired in the Santa Barbara area.</p>  </bioghist>
