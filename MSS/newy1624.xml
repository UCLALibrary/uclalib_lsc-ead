    <head>Biography</head>
<p>Mike Silverton has been a radio producer, columnist, writer, and music reviewer. He worked for the publication <title>Fanfare</title> for more than a decade as well as <title>The Absolute Sound</title> before becoming editor and chief music reviewer for an online review site called <title>La Folia</title>, which grew out of the sponsorship of Madrigal Audio Labs. Silverton publishes comments on Clement Perry's <extref xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:show="new" xlink:href="http://stereotimes.com/">StereoTimes.com </extref> and the Random Noise columns, both of which run in the La Folia site. In the late 1960s, Silverton worked as a liberal radio broadcast producer. It was during this time when he produced several poetry readings for the New School for Social Research and the New York City municipal radio station, WNYC, as well as the Pacifica Foundation's WBAI, KPFA, and KPFK. Additionally, Michael Silverton has written poetry which has appeared in <title>Harper's</title>, <title>The Nation</title>, <title>Chelsea</title>, and other periodicals. His writing has also been included in the anthologies of the late William Cole. Readings of Silverton's works are featured in a two-disk set titled <title>Analogue Smoque</title>, where his non-transactional prose is accompanied by the electronic sounds of Tom Hamilton and Al Margolis.</p>  </bioghist>
