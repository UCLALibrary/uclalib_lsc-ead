<head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>The album opens with a view of rowboats on the beach of Monterey Bay; there is also a view of the beach in Pacific Grove. Historical sites documented include the old custom house, built by Spain in 1814, inherited by Mexico, and finally claimed by the United States in 1846; the landing place of Father Junipero Serra on June 3, 1770; the old Pacific Hotel, built in 1834, and the Washington Hotel, dating from 1832; Colton Hall, first capitol building of California where its first convention was held Sept 1, 1849; the sandstone church of San Carlos, the Royal Presidio Chapel in Monterey, completed in 1794 on the site of the original San Carlos Borromeo mission which had been moved to Carmel in 1771, a year after its founding by Junipero Serra; and Santa Clara Mission, founded 1777. The photographer has also documented some early Monterey buildings: the first brick house in California (1847), the first theater in California, where Jenny Lind sang (1847), and the first wooden building in California, constructed in 1849 with lumber from Australia. Also pictured is the home of Robert Louis Stevenson, located at 530 Houston Street, and the Casa de los Cuatro Vientos or House of Four Winds, built in 1835, the first house to have a weathervane on its roof; it later became the first Hall of Records for Monterey County, and also served as Gen. Halleck and Gen. Sherman's headquarters during the Civil War. There are photos of the giant redwoods in the Big Trees Park in the Santa Cruz Mountains (now called Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park), the Memorial Arch at Stanford University, completed in 1899, and the Sherman Rose Tree in Monterey.</p>
