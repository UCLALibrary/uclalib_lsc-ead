<p>Exhibit C introductory statement must be included in the collection and must be shown to users before accessing the collection:</p><p>"We are Sam Feder and Amy Scholder, producers of the documentary feature film, Disclosure, and the creators of The Disclosure Collection, which documents our process from researcher, production, and screenings, to education and outreach.</p><p>After premiering the film at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2020, we have been pursuing a permanent home for our research, interviews, and information about the project and the many people who collaborated with us, and the many lives who have been touched and inspired by the film and the community it centers.</p><p>Three years after the release of the film on Netflix, we are delighted to donate this Collection to the UCLA Library, to be part of the UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive and UCLA Library Special Collections.</p><p>We included research interviews, which were conducted in 2015 and 2016. These are not included in the documentary and were filmed as a way to preserve the information they provided. There was very little data or research on the topic of transgender representation in 2015, so through our research interviews we were able to create the primary documents on which we based the film.</p><p>We welcome you to review, take notes from (not photos or videos though), and enjoy these materials for your research, education, and learning. The moving images have an indelible watermark on it to remind you that you are using this for your benefit and not for commercial re-use in any manner.</p><p>If you are interested in licensing any elements of the collection for your own or other use, we welcome your inquiries: disclosuredocumentary@gmail.com.</p><p>Please respect the rights of the Collection and the privacy of the interviewees. Do not photograph or re-record any images while you peruse the materials or re-post anything on social media or in any other manner. Please do not copy any of the materials and display them, even with the watermark.</p><p>We thank you in advance for visiting the Disclosure Collection and hope you will view the film as well.</p><p>Sam Feder and Amy Scholder</p><p>September 2023"</p>  </accessrestrict>
