    <abstract id="aspace_c52badcf6d0d422bd9a03bd7ad514e9f">David Saucedo, a former musician turned actor, started his first band after seeing The Plugz play in Los Angeles in the late 70s. David was at the "Punk Massacre" show at the Elks Lodge in Macarthur Park on March 17, 1979. While he did receive a baton blow to his back from one of LA's finest, he managed to find the guest list and the Go-Go's setlist lying on the ground getting trampled on by people running out of the venue. The collection consists of a copy of SLUSH #2; one Go-Go's St. Patrick's Dance at Elks Hall setlist; four punk buttons, one St. Patrick's Dance at Elks Hall poster and one guest list; one Los Angeles Times clipping concerning the police raid at Elks Hall show; one white plastic X; three audiocassettes; one black bound scrapbook of autographs which includes tickets to shows and band stickers.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>David Saucedo, a former musician turned actor started his first band after seeing The Plugz play in Los Angeles in the late 70s. He had met Tito Larriva back in high school in El Paso, Texas. Through Tito, David saw The Germs, The Go-Go's, and X among others. Although El Paso was a punk rock desert, David formed a band with his then girlfriend on vocals, his brother on drums and Tito's brother on guitar. They found like-minded musicians, music fans, and built their tribe. </p><p>David was at the infamous show at the Elks Lodge in Macarthur Park on March 17, 1979. While he did receive a baton blow to his back (he wasn't moving fast enough) from one of LA's finest, he managed to find the folder that had the guest list along with the Go-Go's setlist. They were lying on the ground getting trampled on by people running out of the venue. He's held on to them since that day and never felt right about putting them up for sale. David felt it was an important piece of punk rock history and donating them to UCLA felt more appropriate.</p><p>The autographs were collected at various venues, back in the day when it was much easier to get backstage and meet the bands. He didn't understand a word The Clash said to him other than "mate" but they were super friendly. The Talking Heads' manager welcomed David to the band's dressing room and he was able to hang out for a bit. The Talking Heads were super excited about their visit to White Sands National Park and couldn't believe such a place existed. </p><p>The recording of "X" at the Hot Klub in Dallas was done with a cassette recorder that David took into the club, to capture a bit of 
history.</p><p>The other items in the collection were gathered over the years.</p><p>Source: Biography by David Saucedo.</p>  </bioghist>
