<head>Biography/History</head>
<p>Ruth Joy Rosenbaum was born in Hartford Connecticut in 1916 to a politically progressive family. She was a young girl when her father, a plant pathologist, died of a bacterial infection following the extraction of a tooth. Her mother relocated the family to the Republican town of Milford where Ruth excelled in academics, gained entrance to Cornell University, majored in English and planned to teach after graduation. However, she changed her mind after she toured Europe in 1936 with the American Student Union and witnessed the rise of fascism.</p>
<p>When she returned to the United States, it was with inspiration to make social change through legislative action so she enrolled in Cornell Law School. There she competed for the editorship of the 
<title render="italic">Cornell Journal of Opinion</title> with pre-med student, Milton Roemer, whom she married in 1939. Upon graduation, she worked as a labor lawyer representing unions through the 1940s and 1950s until she participated in a landmark study of the laws governing admission to mental hospitals in New York state. This work was published in 1962 as a book, 
<title render="italic">Mental Health and Due Process</title> that called for significant reforms, which were adopted by the New York legislature two years later.</p>
<p>This project led to her newfound focus during the 1960s on public health law and set the stage for her next four decades of legislative activism following her move to Los Angeles. Roemer joined the UCLA School of Public Health in 1962 as a researcher and a professor whose work centered on laws governing abortion and family planning, international tobacco control and health legislation reform.</p>
<p>Shortly after her move to Los Angeles, Roemer helped organize the California Committee on Therapeutic Abortion (CCTA), formed to provide public education and leadership on the state's abortion law reform. Roemer served as vice president from 1965 to 1976 and led the CCTA's contribution to the enactment of the California Therapeutic Abortion Act in 1967.</p>
<p>Roemer's work turned to global tobacco control during her last two decades. She had been a heavy cigarette smoker until 1961 when her husband Milton persuaded her to stop. She switched to smoking pipes until she quit in 1972. She believed tobacco use was an epidemic and began service as a consultant for the World Health Organization (WHO). She completed a world review of tobacco legislation in 1982 and the WHO first published these findings in her book, 
<title render="italic">Legislative Action to Combat the World Tobacco Epidemic</title>. After the second edition was published, the WHO invited her to collaborate with attorney Allyn Taylor in 1996 to prepare a document that helped launch the WHO's first international convention on tobacco control.</p>
<p>Roemer served as President of the American Public Health Association (APHA), the oldest and largest professional association of public health workers in the world. She is the author of countless publications and the recipient of numerous awards including the WHO's Medal on Tobacco or Health, the APHA's Sedgwick Memorial Medal for Distinguished Service in Public Health and the UCLA Public Health Student Association's Faculty of the Year Award.</p>
<p>On August 1, 2005 Ruth Roemer passed away at 89. At the time of her death, she was planning her classes for fall quarter.</p>
