    <head>Biography/History</head>
<p>Aldous Leonard Huxley was born on July 26, 1894 in Surrey, England; a disease of the eyes permanently weakened his vision at age 16, disrupting his plan to enter the medical profession; BA, Balliol College, Oxford, 1916; employed by the British government during World War I; schoolmaster at Eton College, 1917-19; staff member of <title>Athenaeum and Westminster gazette</title>, 1919-24; published his first novel, <title>Chrome yellow</title>, in 1921; went on to write <title>Point counter point</title> (1928), <title>Brave new world</title> (1932), <title>Eyeless in Gaza</title> (1936), and <title>Island</title> (1962), among others; was a prolific writer of essays, poetry, criticism, and screenplays; received D. Litt. from University of California in 1959; died on November 22, 1963 in California.</p><p>Laura Huxley was born on November 2, 1911 in Turin (Torino), Italy. Laura studied violin since the age of ten, and as a teenager, continued her studies of the instrument in Berlin, Paris, and Rome. She eventually toured Europe and the United States, performing at Carnegie Hall and further pursuing her music study at the Curtis Institute of Philadelphia. </p><p>During World War II, Laura decided to remain in the United States and live with her close friend --- sister to Ernest Hemingway's second wife, Pauline Pfeiffer Hemingway --- Virginia Pfeiffer. Laura Huxley's study in psychotherapy, health, and nutrition was prompted by Virginia Pfeiffer's diagnosis of cancer in 1949. Before her studies and career in well-being, psychology, and health, Laura Huxley worked in Hollywood. Aldous Huxley and his first wife, Maria, met Laura Archera in 1948 while living in Wrightwood, California. In 1955, Maria Huxley died of breast cancer. One year after Maria's death, Aldous and Laura were married in Yuma, California. Together, they moved into a home in Hollywood Hills on Deronda Drive. After their house and most of Aldous's personal manuscripts and library were burned in a fire on May 12, 1961, the couple moved in with Virginia Pfeiffer and her two adopted children.</p><p>In 1959, before the fire, Aldous Huxley presented a series of lectures at the University of California, Santa Barbara called "The Human Situation." In 1961, Huxley repeated a variation of "The Human Situation" in a lecture series he presented at M.I.T. when he was the Carnegie Visiting Professor in Humanities. Huxley also spoke on "Human Potentialities" at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California. In 1960, Aldous Huxley was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer. Aldous Huxley wrote and published his last novel, <title>Island</title>, in 1962. He died on November 22, 1963, the same day President John F. Kennedy was assassinated.</p><p>In 1963, Laura published her book, <title>You Are Not the Target</title>. She also offered psychological health and well-being guidance in the form of workshops and seminars to various groups and individuals in Southern California. Laura went on to publish a personal account of her life with Aldous in a book titled <title>This Timeless Moment</title> in 1969. Her later publications include <title>Between Heaven and Earth: Recipes for Living and Loving</title> (1974), <title>Oneaday Reason to be Happy</title> (1986) and <title>The Child of Your Dreams</title> (1987), co-authored with her nephew, Piero Ferrucci. In 1977, she founded a non-profit organization called, "Our Ultimate Investment" (OUI) which later became "Children: Our Ultimate Investment." The organization sponsored conferences on the topic of "the nurturing of the possible human" in 1978 and 1994. Among the awards and acknowledgments given to Laura Huxley in her life are an Honorary Doctorate in Human Services from La Sierra University and the Thomas R. Verny Award from the Association of Prenatal and Perinatal Psychology and Health in December of 2003. Laura Huxley died of cancer on December 13, 2007 in her Hollywood home.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>The first 10 boxes of this collection consist primarily of business correspondence between Aldous Huxley and publishers Harper &amp; Row, personal correspondence, and literary manuscripts. Correspondents include Jacob Zeitlin, Lawrence Clark Powell, Gerald Heard, Lewis Mumford, Hugh Trevor-Roper, and Lionel Trilling. Literary manuscripts include <title>The devils of Loudon</title> and <title>Time must have a stop</title>.</p><p>Boxes 11-15 include the books from Aldous Huxley's personal library. These items are catalogued in the UCLA online library catalog. </p><p>Following the first 15 boxes, the additions to this original acquisition (added between 2009 to 2011) consist of personal papers, handwritten notes, typed drafts of articles, essays and novels, galleys, day calendars, sketchbooks, drafts of previously unpublished essays, collected clippings, journal articles, off-prints, magazines, personal effects such as pens, eyeglasses, eye patches, memberships cards and a passport. </p><p>The collection contains audio-visual materials such as sound recordings in reel and cassette tape formats as well as recorded film reels and VHS videos. The collection also contains photographs and assorted negatives. </p><p>The first level of organization of the additions has been arranged into two record groups according to their creator, either Aldous Huxley or Laura Huxley. The series under each record group reflect the materials and intellectual content of the material therein. The materials organized under the record group "Aldous Huxley Papers" are organized into series that are slightly different from the series organizing the "Laura Huxley Papers," reflecting the slightly different nature of the materials within the record group. The first 10 boxes of the collection were arranged and assigned series at an earlier time than the additions. For this reason the series organizing these first 15 boxes do not fall within the organizational schema applied to the additions to the collection. Therefore the correspondence in this record group "The Aldous Huxley Papers" can be found under a few different series: 'Correspondence' (Box 1) and 'Personal: Correspondence' (Boxes 48-49). Within a series there are often subseries categories that further organize the material. For example, under the 'Personal' series of "The Aldous Huxley Papers" are the subseries: Correspondence, [last writings on deathbed], Family Related, Personal Effects, Recordings, Research Related and Sketch. The subseries under the series 'Personal' in the Laura Huxley Papers section of the collection include: Collected by, Correspondence, Early Life, Film, Personal Effects, recordings, Video Recordings and Virginia Pfeiffer. The other series in the collection also have subseries categories, some of which are by media type such as 'Recordings,' while other subseries are the title of a work or lecture or the name of a correspondent. </p>  </scopecontent>

True, they do not call it the Kingdom of God; but in all essentials the Perfect State of their socialist or fascist imagination is indistinguishable from the transfigured earth of the Early Christian millenium. It is a world where truth, justice and mercy everywhere prevail; where reason dominates the passions; where men are exclusively their better selves. The Early Christians believed that this transformation would be accomplished by the direct intervention of a higher power. Their modern counterparts smile at this ingenuous faith; they believe in Organization.

The chapter, which belongs after Chapter 5 of the published book, describes Sebastian Barnack's journey from Turin to Florence in a third-class carriage. His father sits opposite reading an economic report, frowning. At Genoa a man gets on the train and sits down next to Sebastian. This mysterious man in brown first entertains the children by drawing riddles, then talks to Sebastian with a strange and holy wisdom, eventually introducing himself as Bruno Rontini, a bookseller (His acquaintance with uncle Eustace, here called Hubert, is not mentioned). When Sebastian's father finally takes notice, he debates with Bruno, organization versus sanctity, while Sebastian retires within himself to compose a poem in his head.</p></scopecontent><bibliography id="aspace_e20e6b364055401388bea7d0c9a10d02"><head>Bibliography</head><bibref>Published by Harper &amp; Brother, New York, 1944; Chatto &amp; Windus, London, 1945.</bibref></bibliography></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref232_dpu" level="item"><did><unittitle><title>Variations on a Philosopher.
