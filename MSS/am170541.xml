    <head>Biography</head>
<p>Jose Amesti was a Spanish Basque who arrived in Monterey, California in the early nineteen hundreds. In 1822, he married Prudenciana Vallejo, daughter of Jose Vallejo, and the sister of Mariano Vallejo. Governor Alvarado granted Amesti the 15,400-acre Corralitos Ranch in 1827. Within a few years, Amesti had leased portions of his property for timber cutting, and established his own whipsaw lumber mill on the upper portion of the rancho. Jose Amesti and his wife Pudenciana Vallejo de Amesti had four daughters, Carmen, Santa, Celedonia and Tomasa Madariaga y Vallejo, who was adopted. All shared equally in the estate.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>This ledger is comprised of customer, client and employee names, orders, and inventories from Amesti's mill enterprise from the period of 1840 to 1866. Payments are recorded in pesos and silver; customers include the Mission San Diego and other California ranchos. The manuscript also contains information about Amesti's personal life, such as notes about life on the ranch, his feelings on the U.S.-Mexican War, the dowry of his adopted daughter, and the Mission Indians that the ranch employed. The record includes their wages, clothing items, and descriptions of labor. Following the description of the Mission Indians, there are ledgers concerning clothing items and food--possibly deductions taken out of their wages for clothing, liquor, and food. The manuscript also contains an inventory of harvested produce, and tools used in the mill. Some of the goods mentioned include garbanzos, pinto beans, lard, dried meat, chiles, potatoes, corn,and molasses.</p>  </scopecontent>
