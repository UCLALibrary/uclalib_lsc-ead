    <head>Biography</head>
<p><title render="italic">Last Call at Maud's</title>, is a 1993 documentary on the San Francisco lesbian bar Maud's that operated from 1966-1989. The film discusses the cultural and historical significance of the bar as well as the vitality of the bar scene for lesbians throughout California. It sets the historical, cultural and social context for the opening of Maud's, including the formation of the Daughters of Bilitis in 1955, the development of the San Francisco lesbian community, and the need for alternatives to gay men's bars which were the targets of police raids throughout the 1950's. The film also discusses the decline of Maud's, including the AIDS crisis and the assassination of Harvey Milk. The documentary uses archival documents and first person interviews. The film was directed by Paris Poirier and produced by Paris Poirier and Karen Kiss.</p><p>Rikki Streicher (1926-1994) was the owner and operator of Maud's throughout its existence; she also owned the lesbian bar Amelia's. She was a leader in San Francisco's gay rights movement and a creator of the Federation of Gay Games. She was also active in organizing the Gay Games in San Francisco. At the time of her passing in 1994 she was survived by her partner of many years, Mary Sager.</p>  </bioghist>
