    <head>Biography/History</head>
<p>Marjeanne Jensen Blinn was a 1962 graduate of the UCLA Graduate School of Library Service and later served as an assistant librarian at the UCLA University Elementary School Library. Blinn compiled and edited the anthology <title render="italic">Summoned by Books: Essays and Speeches by Frances Clarke Sayers</title>. While enrolled in the School of Library Service, which later became the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, Blinn was a student of Frances Clarke Sayers (1897-1989) who lectured on children's literature at UCLA from 1954 to 1965. After graduation, Blinn frequently attended and recorded Sayers' lectures, workshops, and symposiums. Blinn began working very closely with Sayers on the anthology in the fall of 1963, and was granted a summer leave of absence from the University Elementary School Library to work full time on the book in 1964. <title>Summoned by Books: Essays and Speeches by Frances Clarke Sayers</title>, which includes an introduction by Dr. Lawrence Clark Powell (1906-2001), was published in 1965.</p>  </bioghist>
