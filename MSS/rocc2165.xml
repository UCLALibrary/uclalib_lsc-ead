<head>Biography</head>
<p>Francesca Roccaforte was born and raised in New York City, where her early love of photography and aesthetics was nurtured and developed by her parents and environment. Her first solo show was at an organization called the "Door" in the West Village in the 1970s. The "Door" nurtured her creative teenage energy and enabled her to prepare for both intense photographic studies at the School of Visual Arts and Creative Writing at Hunter College in New York. She spent four years immersed in photo studies, and working part time as a documentary photographer, performing arts photographer and darkroom technician. She has taken workshops and classes with W. Eugene Smith, Ansel Adams, Eve Sonneman, Cora Wright Kennedy, Dena, and Alice Beck at the School of Visual Arts.</p>
<p>Roccaforte relocated to the San Francisco area at the age of 23 after a photography trip documenting spirituality and religious customs in Italy, Israel and the United States. She was employed in several photography labs and camera stores and completed her visual arts education in California by earning degrees and/or certificates from The California College of Arts, Berkeley City College and Cal State East Bay. Her thesis project, which focused on portraits and accompanying oral herstories of Italian women was both exhibited and published in the 1990s. She has worked as a freelance photographer, worked in educational and medical institutions and assisted with production and operational aspects of film festivals and accompanying events. Currently, she teaches beginning and advanced digital photography to adult learners. She also exhibits her photographic art in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
