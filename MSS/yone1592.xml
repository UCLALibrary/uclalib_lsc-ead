    <head>Biography/History</head>
<p>Karl G. Yoneda was born in Glendale, California in 1906 to Japanese immigrant parents. Because of his father's illness, the Yoneda family left the United States for Japan in 1913. During his stay in Japan, Yoneda received his education and was influenced by left-wing and socialist ideas. Escaping from Japanese conscription, he returned alone to the United States in 1926. In the United States he joined the American Communist Party, which launched his career as a labor and union organizer. As a longshoreman by trade, he was affiliated with the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (ILWU), and also served as the vice president and delegate of the Congress of Industrial Organizations Alaskan Cannery Workers Union. He was an editor of ???? Rodo Shinbun [= Japanese labor news] in San Francisco, an official newspaper of the Japanese section of the American Communist Party, and a contributor to ?? Doho, a Japanese American leftist newspaper (a broad united front progressive paper) published in Los Angeles. He was also a poet, publishing poems under several pseudonyms.</p><p>During World War II, Yoneda and his wife, Elaine Black Yoneda, were interned in the Manzanar War Relocation Center in Independence, California. During incarceration, he served as a block manager and also formed the Manzanar Citizens Federation, which consisted of pro-American and pro-communist internees. Its purpose was to improve camp conditions, initiate leadership education, participate in war efforts, and prepare evacuees for postwar life. In the camp, he volunteered to join the Military Intelligence Service Language School and was enlisted in the Psychological Warfare Team, the United States Office of War Information (OWI), and served for the China-Burma-India Theater.</p><p>Starting in the late 1960s, Yoneda gave lectures and talks in various classes and programs of academic institutions on the West Coast and in Hawaii. He also authored publications in English and Japanese. In 1999, Yoneda passed away at age 92 in Fort Bragg, California.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>The collection consists of materials related to Karl Yoneda's involvement in the Japanese American left and labor movement, World War II internment, and the United States Military services. It includes original manuscripts, publications, correspondence, photographs, and photocopied testimonies and investigation case files. Of note are leaflets and newspapers published and distributed by the Japanese Bureau of the American Communist Party, leftist groups, and labor union members between 1923 and 1939. The materials were distributed among Japanese communities in California, Seattle, Alaska, New York, Hawaii, Canada, Japan, and Shanghai for various purposes, including to call for community participation internationally in the political fight against Japanese imperialism and in the support of communists and the Soviet Union, and to advocate improvement of working conditions and higher wages of local labor workers in California.</p><p>The collection also contains materials related to the internment of Yoneda and his wife, Elaine Black Yoneda, in the Manzanar War Relocation Center. Materials Yoneda collected immediately following the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 depict the anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States, while the materials written by Yoneda and/or the Japanese American community groups express their faithful allegiance to the United States. During incarceration, Yoneda served as a block manager as well as a member of the Manzanar Citizens Federation; as a result, this collection also contains Yoneda's reports and letters describing the camp conditions, its organization and administration structure, jobs and wages, activities, and programs.</p><p>Propaganda materials included in the collection consist of ?? dentan [= airborne leaflets], newspapers, pamphlets, and a military song book produced by the United States Psychological Warfare Team, Office of War Information. The purpose of propaganda materials was to call on Japanese soldiers to surrender in the China-Burma-India Theater between 1944 and 1945. </p><p>Most of the collection is written in English and Japanese; some Japanese texts are attached with an English synopsis and annotations. A small portion of materials are written in Chinese, Korean, Burmese, and Russian.</p>  </scopecontent>
