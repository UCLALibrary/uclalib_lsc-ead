    <head>Biographical Narrative</head>
<p>Born Simeon Charles Levi in Chicago in 1899, Lee was the son of American-born parents of German-Jewish ancestry, Julius and Hattie (Stiller) Levi. Lee (who later changed his name from Levi) grew up in the Chicago of Daniel Burnham, Louis Sullivan, and Frank Lloyd Wright. Lee's own favorite building was Sullivan's Carson Pirie Scott Department Store. He also grew up with the evolving motion picture; he went to vaudeville theatres, nickolodeons,and early movie houses. A tinkerer interested in mechanical things, Lee built three motorcars as a teenager. </p><p>His interest in mechanics took him to Lake Technical High School in Chicago. He started out in architecture in 1915 by working after school in the office of Chicago architect Henry Newhouse, a family friend. Newhouse specialized in theatre design: small motion picture houses, nickolodeons and remodeling storefronts into theatres. After graduation in 1916, Lee attended Chicago Technical College, graduating with honors in 1918. His first job was as architect for the South Park Board of the City of Chicago. During World War I he enlisted in the Navy. After his discharge in 1920, he entered the Armour Institute of Technology to study architecture. The course followed the principles of the Ecole des Beaux Arts and this training is reflected in the composition and imagery of his later drawings. It is also reflected in his own emphasis on the plan as the driving force of the design. This practical approach would serve him well in his many commercial designs. </p><p>Other influences on the young architect were Sullivan's lectures in his architecture classes and Wright's work, particularly Midway Gardens and Wright's house and studio in Oak Park. Lee was also impressed by the 1922 Chicago Tribune tower competition, which juxtaposed historicism with modernism. Lee considered himself a modernist, and his career revealed both the Beaux Arts discipline and emphasis on planning and the modernist functionalism and freedom of form (Valentine, p.32). He was also a pragmatist, designing his buildings to support and enhance the commercial ventures they housed. </p><p><emph render="italic">Scheid</emph> </p><p>3/13/2000</p>  </bioghist>

Differences between the rendering and the exterior of the finished building show that much of the streamlining was eliminated, with the exception of the curved façade at the corner and the curved form of the pylon. The photographer, Julius Shulman, captured the new theatre in full sunlight with deep shadows; his image accentuates the dramatic black and white contrasts and the sculptural forms of the building. The gently curved blond wood-paneled walls of the auditorium and the flowing figures executed in bas relief flanking the screen carry out the Streamline Moderne theme. The curving, wood-paneled foyer displays a bas relief wood-on-wood mural depicting the arrival of Spanish explorer De Anza in California. An extravagantly curved couch, streamlined settees with curved arms and backs, and a table with curving legs furnish the ladies' lounge. The boxed chandelier susp! ended from the ceiling is typical of the Moderne taste for soft, indirect lighting. Shulman's photograph takes advantage of the strong natural light from the windows to create a study in light and shadow.</p></odd></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref161_ida" level="file"><did><unittitle>De Anza Theatre. - Riverside</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1937-1939</unitdate><physdesc><physfacet id="aspace_2cb7ff45a70fbd88287c4e6c07262e8a">Auditorium</physfacet></physdesc><physdesc><dimensions id="aspace_1cd4aadbcde1ef2fa85ae43a7a95cb07"></dimensions></physdesc><container id="aspace_2f657b9c0dd5feda1d5ab40e949777b6" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_98f59b763335d84d1664d0bf80929f4e" parent="aspace_2f657b9c0dd5feda1d5ab40e949777b6" type="folder">5</container></did><odd id="aspace_a75702b117aad558c4bea02d6159baae"><head>General note</head><p>Streamline Moderne</p></odd></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref165_tex" level="file"><did><unittitle>De Anza Theatre. - Riverside</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1937-1939</unitdate><physdesc><physfacet id="aspace_5509e5899445611881dda76b6a045d58">Lounge</physfacet></physdesc><physdesc><dimensions id="aspace_5e10db60381e4bbf383aac1ad545eb1a"></dimensions></physdesc><container id="aspace_355bc05161c3e38e9a7ea27708bbbcad" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_19cc774f8bb6333197080f2078aee5c5" parent="aspace_355bc05161c3e38e9a7ea27708bbbcad" type="folder">5</container></did><odd id="aspace_fbf6811abf619e92837107443b6087a6"><head>General note</head><p>Streamline Moderne</p></odd></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref169_dlf" level="file"><did><unittitle>De Anza Theatre. - Riverside</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1937-1939</unitdate><physdesc><physfacet id="aspace_503424297660e5d94a6a0b78946bb6a4">Foyer</physfacet></physdesc><physdesc><dimensions id="aspace_a243ca753285ee6b07da4e9929e44fac"></dimensions></physdesc><container id="aspace_e678631859c120eb9a75515a7e505f18" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_0b0cd2e445fabc99ba377429451f64a4" parent="aspace_e678631859c120eb9a75515a7e505f18" type="folder">5</container></did><odd id="aspace_f3e391ff9d25e80d8d8fcbb0adfe57e7"><head>General note</head><p>Streamline Moderne</p></odd></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref173_qd5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Dinuba Theatre. - Dinuba.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1940-1941</unitdate><container id="aspace_cf9a36891f98d7b8bc7181785adfaf02" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_621d0e556ee68edf66c234bcd2101069" parent="aspace_cf9a36891f98d7b8bc7181785adfaf02" type="folder">6</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref174_jgn" level="file"><did><unittitle>Disney Theatre. - Burbank</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1939-1941</unitdate><physdesc><physfacet id="aspace_c8e8cebf88ceed7b89cedf654b02494c">Perspective sketch</physfacet></physdesc><physdesc><dimensions id="aspace_9afbbb0b0dd3b956bb9b213afaa029fa"></dimensions></physdesc><container id="aspace_492575106d39068e3d9d085d35b72b54" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_d55aec5df9e1be8bf49d7a24c8387163" parent="aspace_492575106d39068e3d9d085d35b72b54" type="folder">7</container></did><odd id="aspace_1dbdfc01b67e0a3231932362485d9ef0"><head>General note</head><p>The Disney Theatre was used for private screenings on the Disney lot.

Lee designed several Drive-in theaters, a type especially suited to the mild climate and car-dependent economy of Southern California. The Drive-in allowed the whole family to go to the movies in the family car, with no need for a baby-sitter. It also proved especially popular with dating teen-agers, who found Drive-ins the ideal refuge from watchful adult eyes. The Drive-in was also cheap to build. A large piece of land, a structure to display the screen and smaller buildings for tickets, refreshments and the projector were all that was needed. The parking lot was usually graded to provide the parked cars with a good angle for viewing the screen, and each space was equipped with a speaker that could be hooked to the dashboard to bring the sound into the car.</p></odd></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref238_4x2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Drive-in Theatres. - Arcadia</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1948</unitdate><physdesc><physfacet id="aspace_8050df98f50a0117fc401314490e396e">Perspective sketch</physfacet></physdesc><physdesc><dimensions id="aspace_519d0bf9ad72ae21d5bc2fe1d3ce37d7"></dimensions></physdesc><container id="aspace_44b16c25e7c77bb4bca10193232daa35" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_a2a264eb7a112e415778b7e009d816d6" parent="aspace_44b16c25e7c77bb4bca10193232daa35" type="folder">8</container></did><odd id="aspace_a74cccf8108ff44687dfacf0aea6c5ae"><head>General note</head><p>Lee's renderings for the Edwards Drive-In in Arcadia (1948) show both a perspective plan (1) and a perspective from the road (2).

After 1950, smaller neighborhood theatres and Drive-ins became more popular with the development of the suburbs. The Miami, however, was one of Lee's largest and most all-encompassing designs executed in the United States. The complex included not only a motion picture theatre, which included a legitimate stage but also a restaurant and a candy store, all in a downtown urban setting. In the design, which was largely executed as shown in the renderings, Lee married Baroque and Rococo elements with Streamline Moderne features, producing an unusually eclectic design. The renderings show murals with sea-life motifs, suggesting that Lee drew inspiration from seashell and wave forms for many aspects of the design, which may account for the Baroque and Rococo-appearing design elements. Although demolished, the theatre is o! ne of the most extensively documented in the S. Charles Lee Collection at UCLA.The design of the façade, with its diamond-patterned panels and ornate cartouche is echoed in the interior. On the left is Huyler's, a candy shop and restaurant that was part of the theatre complex. The narrow site and the height of the building to the rear reflect the two-tier balcony and the long narrow plan of the auditorium, a scheme that Lee had used in his first major theatre, the Tower Theatre in Los Angeles.</p></odd></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref783_scc" level="file"><did><unittitle>Miami Theatre. - Miami</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1946-1947</unitdate><physdesc><physfacet id="aspace_1b11c46968f0e834a89b37d0f29bcdf7">Facade detail</physfacet></physdesc><physdesc><dimensions id="aspace_3bf1a802e7ad6009dac9979e8af63e21"></dimensions></physdesc><container id="aspace_b1c10729059cb755c3bf3a0be72559e5" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">4</container><container id="aspace_b0381b0a1bf3d21449f890425f52657c" parent="aspace_b1c10729059cb755c3bf3a0be72559e5" type="folder">8</container></did><odd id="aspace_5e943326fec3d20e8e92a6f20f4cdc88"><head>General note</head><p>The scale of the cartouche is indicated by the life-size cardboard figure posed beside it.</p></odd></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref787_81p" level="file"><did><unittitle>Miami Theatre. - Miami</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1946-1947</unitdate><physdesc><physfacet id="aspace_73c851f81be6d7667d38a140b49eaa50">Projection room</physfacet></physdesc><physdesc><dimensions id="aspace_8696308c413e777bb6852b080becd91c"></dimensions></physdesc><container id="aspace_7c05975d34d3d73c3dba786c969314a8" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">4</container><container id="aspace_a1f6ebeda472ded6733ae1846b8c5cc2" parent="aspace_7c05975d34d3d73c3dba786c969314a8" type="folder">8</container></did><odd id="aspace_efa892588bc3f1397ad0ffcd151f3052"><head>General note</head><p>The projection room is state of the art for 1946.</p></odd></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref791_2vh" level="file"><did><unittitle>Miami Theatre. - Miami</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1946-1947</unitdate><physdesc><physfacet id="aspace_5ba84cc54d70e612e8c69b1facf75bb4">Stair to mezzanine</physfacet></physdesc><physdesc><dimensions id="aspace_b9e789b0633b3a94d116434d3cd6944a"></dimensions></physdesc><container id="aspace_6d12957f34643d700273c9a5d93b417d" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">4</container><container id="aspace_478dbf5d8982ff59b53b959fdee615fa" parent="aspace_6d12957f34643d700273c9a5d93b417d" type="folder">8</container></did><odd id="aspace_d7b5283af20e57d39b5d0e98f2531543"><head>General note</head><p>Executed almost exactly as shown in the rendering (40803), the final forms of the staircase arch and ceiling panels are better integrated than in the rendering.

All the renderings describe in this archive as Theatre Design Concepts are newsreel theatres. The newsreel had been introduced as a short shown before the feature during the 1930s. World War II heightened interest in the newsreel, giving rise to the idea of small theatres showing newsreels only. As technology allowed, Lee began to increase his use of glass and later plastic, both transparent materials that could be used to great effect for buildings whose primary use was at night. Lee's renderings for these designs all show the buildings at night. By using transparent materials, Lee was creating illuminated sculptures that were their own advertisements for the film.Note on reverse: This modern idea has been designed to be inviting, entertaining and smart, to stand out in a busy location. The name on the theatre indicates the design was prepared for M! exico, probably in early 1940s.</p></odd></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref892_8tx" level="file"><did><unittitle>New Theatre Sketches: Diana</unittitle><physdesc><physfacet id="aspace_7e9b81cfb7164509e93654f4d0d06b47">Perspective sketch</physfacet></physdesc><physdesc><dimensions id="aspace_fba6c76312981e1cbf1151c25cce069a"></dimensions></physdesc><container id="aspace_422cd692304fdbb4b66ac30bcc375581" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">5</container><container id="aspace_0251dea9c17af2d1723697faa4e0b4f6" parent="aspace_422cd692304fdbb4b66ac30bcc375581" type="folder">4</container></did><odd id="aspace_5738452be5c56356666f149864a33f46"><head>General note</head><p>Note on reverse: This theatre is designed to be built in plastic; the unusual façade is, therefore, ... ...CHECK ORIGINAL.</p></odd></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref896_f66" level="file"><did><unittitle>New Theatre Sketches: Sign</unittitle><physdesc><physfacet id="aspace_5d617d7185f53db9d6ae7ce973191597">Perspective sketch</physfacet></physdesc><physdesc><dimensions id="aspace_612948b157bfd645998af0457a74c1e1"></dimensions></physdesc><container id="aspace_2e827b926854a3e5d0d00e5691dde20f" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">5</container><container id="aspace_e523075292e197d43749054bfefe635f" parent="aspace_2e827b926854a3e5d0d00e5691dde20f" type="folder">4</container></did><odd id="aspace_37387d01f567ba4513ef365b5c025da0"><head>General note</head><p>Note on reverse: This theatre is built with a glass front so the lobby may be viewed from the street.

The simplest means of quickly constructing a theatre-sized space was to build a Quonset hut, a method devised in the late 1930s using small wood members to create an arched truss frame, which was then often clad in metal for warehouse purposes. A number of motion picture theatres were built in this way. They offered inexpensive rapid construction of theatre spaces in small towns such as Puente, an agricultural community east of Los Angeles.</p></odd></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref995_l30" level="file"><did><unittitle>Raphael Theatre. - San Raphael.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1936</unitdate><container id="aspace_d01468eb2c322702debaef6012eda623" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">6</container><container id="aspace_71a3a20367ed00b47b1c753a1359ffae" parent="aspace_d01468eb2c322702debaef6012eda623" type="folder">1</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref996_8oa" level="file"><did><unittitle>Reforma Theatre - Mexico City</unittitle><physdesc><physfacet id="aspace_4dd047c82530a1d61fb5feb252581825">Perspective sketch</physfacet></physdesc><physdesc><dimensions id="aspace_35d34a23dfd6d07a011dd4d4ace0dda9"></dimensions></physdesc><container id="aspace_61e0ea45846f7e5557977dcdae65bd50" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">6</container><container id="aspace_9bffef4b6eee4dbab8f0db0400a7e0a0" parent="aspace_61e0ea45846f7e5557977dcdae65bd50" type="folder">2</container></did><odd id="aspace_2a4a0bab58122770021a7887d8f05d17"><head>General note</head><p>This theatre and office complex, perhaps taking its name from the Avenida de la Reforma in Mexico City, may be one of Lee's concepts for the Chapultepec Theatre (see 12401-12408) in Mexico City, which was located on the Avenida de la Reforma.
