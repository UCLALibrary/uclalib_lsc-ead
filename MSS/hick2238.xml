<head>Biography/History</head>
<p>Frederic Hicks was a distinguished scholar of Mesoamerican ethnohistory and anthropology. He was born in New Orleans on January 7, 1928, and was raised in Connecticut. After completing his Bachelors in Anthropology at the University of New Mexico, he earned his Ph.D. at UCLA, working on George Brainerd’s archaeological project at Cerro Portezuelo, Mexico and coauthoring “The Transition from Classic to Postclassic at Cerro Portezuelo” with H.B. Nicholson in 1962. He then received a Fulbright teaching grant to study and work in Paraguay for three years.</p>
<p>In 1965, Hicks began teaching at the University of Louisville, eventually becoming Chair of the Anthropology Department. He was very active in the local progressive social justice community, alongside his wife Dr. Judith Joel. Hicks made fundamental contributions to anthropological understandings of pre-Columbian Aztec society, including the nature of taxation, tribute, and labor organization, the political dynamics of local and imperial organizations, and the social organization and economic stratification of the empire. He served as President and Chair of the Robert F. Heizer Prize Committee for the American Society for Ethnohistory, as well as organizing numerous conference sessions and symposia on Anthropology and Ethnohistory.</p>
<p>After his retirement, Hicks returned to his research on Cerro Portezuelo, hoping to complete a book on the project. His most recent article about the site’s architecture was published in Ancient Mesoamerica shortly before his death. He also co-edited an annotated facsimile edition of the Codex Vergara, an Aztec cadastral document drawn up by the Spanish conquerors of Mexico. The project reflects his decades of experience in Mexican archives, his deep knowledge of anthropology and ethnohistorical literature, and extensive personal collection of source materials.</p>
<p>Frederic Hicks participated in trips to China, Cuba, Iran, Tibet, Nepal and Bhutan after his retirement, continuing to research and write academically almost until his last hour. He died July 9, 2013 in Louisville at age 85, after being diagnosed with lung cancer.</p>
