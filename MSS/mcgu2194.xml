In 1968 she published a short story in the lesbian publication The Ladder entitled "The Intake Interview," which dealt with lesbian identity in the context of the mental health profession both as a patient and as a health care provider. This collection contains correspondence, referrals and reports related to preliminary assessments of patients involved in psychoanalysis and/or psychotherapy.</abstract>
