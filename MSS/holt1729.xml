<abstract id="ref2" label="Abstract">Isadora Duncan (1877-1927) was a modern dance pioneer influenced by Walt Whitman, Emerson and American Transcendentalism. She first gained recognition and support for her work after moving to London (1899). In 1904, she met Edward Gordon Craig, and they worked and toured together for three years. Later, she opened a school of dance for children in Bellevue near Paris (1914), and another in Moscow (1921). She continued to dance until her accidental death in 1927. 
<lb/>Howard M. Holtzman (1921-1990) was a poet, lawyer and collector. His interest in Isadora Duncan began when he read her memoirs and sought to explore and document the influence of her artistic expression on the history of art. Recognizing the role that certain relationships, both personal and artistic, came to play in shaping her artistic development, Holtzman collected materials that reflect others' influences on Isadora, documented the impressions of many people who had seen her perform, and acquired the Edward Gordon Craig material in this collection. 
<lb/>The collection consists of Isadora Duncan's business and personal papers, primary writings, and material about her. There are also materials by and about Edward Gordon Craig, Raymond Duncan, and Ellen Terry. Materials include dance programs, business correspondence, writings by Isadora Duncan, photographs, objets d'art created by her brother Raymond, research materials compiled by her biographer, Allan Ross Macdougall and collector Howard Holtzman, correspondence between Howard Holtzman and Irma Duncan, and programs and photographs of other dancers who influenced or were influenced by Isadora Duncan.</abstract>

<head>Biography</head>
<p>Howard M. Holtzman (1921-1990) was a poet, lawyer and collector. His interest in Isadora Duncan began when he read her memoirs and sought to explore and document the influence of her artistic expression on the history of art. For the next 32 years, he collected materials by and about Isadora Duncan. Recognizing the role that certain relationships, both personal and artistic, came to play in shaping her artistic development, Holtzman acquired the Edward Gordon Craig material in this collection. For the performing arts, the transition from the 19th to the 20th century was a change from the pictorial and romantic to a more architectural and impressionistic framework. Craig's work in the theatre and Duncan's in dance promoted these developments, and their collaborative works were considered revolutionary. Ellen Terry, Craig's mother and a famous Shakespearean actress, was a model for both of them as her artistic interests incorporated theatre, dance, music, and the visual arts and architecture. Holtzman conducted extensive research and collected materials that reflect others' influences on Isadora, and documented the impressions of many people who had seen her perform.</p>
<p>Born Mary Dora Duncan on May 26, 1877 in San Francisco, Isadora Duncan lived with her mother, sister Elizabeth and brothers Augustine and Raymond in Oakland, California, where she began to teach dance at the age of eleven. Her mother introduced her to Dickens, Shakespeare and Greek mythology, and played works by Chopin and Schubert on the piano. She and her siblings spent many hours at home in the evenings, and sometimes at salons organized by her mother, where they recited from literature and danced. Her mother also read to the children from "free thinker" Robert Ingersoll, who rejected institutionalized religion. In developing her own form of art, Isadora Duncan was influenced by Walt Whitman, Emerson and American Transcendentalism, believing that dance movement should be motivated from within, based on a spiritual understanding of nature. Isadora and her family moved to Chicago in 1896, New York and then London in 1899, where she gained recognition and her work was supported by society patrons, artists and intellectuals. In Berlin in 1904 she met Edward Gordon Craig, with whom she fell in love. She and Craig worked and toured together for three years in Germany, Russia, Poland and Sweden. She opened a school of dance for children in Bellevue near Paris in 1914, and another in Moscow in 1921, and adopted several of her students, who peformed as "The Isadorables" and "The Isadora Duncan Dancers of Moscow." Isadora Duncan married twice, to Paris Singer in 1909 and Serge Essenin in 1922. She had two children, a daughter with Edward Gordon Craig (Deirdre) and a son (Patrick) with Singer. Both were drowned in a car that accidentally rolled into the Seine in 1913. She continued to dance until 1927. While riding in a Bugati, a scarf tied around her neck caught in the wheel, causing her death in Nice, France, on September 14, 1927.</p>

<scopecontent><p>This subseries includes materials about Isadora Duncan and her work.
Dance programs for performances by Isadora Duncan, 1906-1927, and by "The
Isadorables" and "The Isadora Duncan Dancers of Moscow," 1919-1929. Most of the
original drawings, sketches and prints of Isadora Duncan, 1905-1952, are framed or in
portfolios. There are works by many artists, including Edward Gordon Craig, Raymond
Duncan, Jules Grandjouan, Jose Clara, Dunoyer De Segonzac, Valentine Lecomte, Abram
 Walkowitz, Leon Bakst, Berthe Martinie, Myron Nutting, and Van Saanen Algi. Also
included are three-dimensional works by Antoine Bourdelle, Marcel Sprank and Lare
Hayman. Writings about Isadora Duncan, primarily magazine articles from 1900-1987, are
organized chronologically. Howard Holtzman also researched and typed citations about
Isadora Duncan, organized by works, and corresponded with Irma Duncan from 1974 until
her death in 1977. Many of the oral history interviews on reel-to-reel tape and cassette,
with Ruth St. Denis, Hedwig Reicher and Cornelia Lysight, a childhood friend of Isadora
Duncan, were conducted by Howard Holtzman. Two oral histories created by radio station
KPFK are also included.</p></scopecontent>

by William Beaumont Morris with marginal notes and his essay on dance bound in. Also
included are Edward Gordon Craig's hand colored drawings of Isadora later used for her
bookplate, photographs, English transcriptions of a Brazilian review of a performance in
Rio de Janeiro by Isadora Duncan, a copy of Francois Bernouard's poem about Isadora and
 dedicated to A. de Segonzac. A letter from Raymond Duncan is inserted, with a copy of
Lecomte's drawing which he dedicates to "... that very dear and beloved Valentine
Lecomte." Raymond Duncan indicates Lecomte's drawings are the best and most truthful
to the spirit of Isadora's dancing. </p></note>

that the reader who is capable of a true work of creative synthesis (admittedly such readers
may be rare), may be able to do more than just re-read the clich� that dance is 'the most
transitory of arts.'" </p></scopecontent>

 <scopecontent><p>Edward Gordon Craig (1872-1966), son of reknowned Shakespearean
 actress Ellen Terry (1847-1928), was a set designer, producer, artist and author/illustrator of
 numerous theatrical publications. In 1904 he met Isadora Duncan in Berlin, where they
 fell in love. For the following three years they lived and worked together. Craig produced
 many of the stage designs for Isadora Duncan's dances and worked as her manager. A
 daughter, Deirdre, was born to them in 1906. She was drowned in a car accident in Paris in
 1913, at which time Isadora Duncan was living with Paris Singer.
 Included in this series are photographs of and articles about Edward Gordon Craig, a letter
 from Craig to Ellen Terry, and programs and prints created by him. It also includes a
 boxed set with a photograph, woodblock prints by Craig and an LP on which he discusses
 Isadora and other subjects pertaining to the theatre.
 Books by and about Edward Gordon Craig from this collection were removed to Special
 Collections book stacks. </p></scopecontent>

<note><p>Photographic print reproduction with caption, "The Latest Portrait of Ellen Terry
 Made in America: By Permission of Arnold Genthe" and two quotes, "A smile wherein
each mortal reads, The very sympathy he needs. An eye like to a mystic book, Of lays that
bard or prophet sings." ELLEN TERRY -- "I announce the Great Individual, Fluid as Nature,
 chaste, affectionate, compassionate, fully armed; I announce a life that shall be copious,
vehement, spiritual, bold, And I announce an end that shall lightly and joyfully meet its
translation." "So Long!" Walt Whitman. Clipping appears to be a page from a book.
