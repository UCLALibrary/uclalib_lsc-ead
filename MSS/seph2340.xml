    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>After centuries of established life on the Iberian Peninsula, Jews were formally expelled by Spanish royal decree in 1492. With many refugees settling in North Africa and the Ottoman Empire, these Jews developed a distinct Sephardic (meaning Spanish, in Hebrew) culture and community that included the retention and development of a unique hybrid language, known as Judeo-Spanish or Ladino. At the outset of the 20th century, these Sephardic Jews sought better futures elsewhere, such as in sub-Saharan Africa, Western Europe, South America, and the United States. In search of economic opportunity and respite from political turmoil in the crumbling Ottoman Empire, many of these Sephardic Jews found their way to Los Angeles, a rapidly growing commercial and industrial metropolis. Throughout the century, the Sephardic community in Los Angeles would expand and come to include Jews from various backgrounds, notably North African, Israeli, and Persian Jews. By the end of the century, Los Angeles had solidified its status as a center of Sephardic life worldwide.</p><p>The Comunidad Sefardi de Los Angeles (Sephardic Community of Los Angeles) was officially formed in 1920 by a few dozen young immigrant men, though its roots go back to 1912 with the formation of Ahavat Shalom (Love of Peace). Catering to members from cities along Turkey's Mediterranean coast - like Istanbul, Bursa, and Izmir - these organizations were simultaneously religious, social, cultural, and economic in nature. Soon after in 1921, another Sephardic organization, Haim vaHessed (Life and Kindness), was formed and later changed its name to the Sephardic Brotherhood. The center of Sephardic life was to be found primarily in and around downtown until the 1930s, when it moved southwest towards South Los Angeles and the Exposition Park area. The Community's synagogue, Tifereth Israel, was inaugurated in 1932 and built on Santa Barbara Avenue, now Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. In 1959, a congregational merger created the Sephardic Community and Brotherhood of Los Angeles. Beginning in 1967, plans for a new temple in Westwood were underway that were ultimately realized during a final dedication ceremony in 1981. Over time, the organization and synagogue names would both be identified as the Sephardic Temple Tifereth Israel (STTI), as it is known at the time of processing (2019).</p><p>Parallel to and closely intertwined with STTI is another Sephardic congregation in Los Angeles that was formed in 1917 as Sociedad Pas i Progreso (Peace and Progress Society) and consisted mainly of Jews from the Island of Rhodes. In 1935, after inaugurating a synagogue in South Los Angeles at 55th St. and Hoover, they changed their name to the Sephardic Hebrew Center. After moving their temple to Ladera Heights in the late 1960s, SHC changed their name to Sephardic Beth Shalom in 1992, only to merge with Sephardic Temple Tifereth Israel (STTI) in 1993.</p><p>These organizations each had their own women's groups - known as Sisterhoods or Ladies' Auxiliaries - that catered to their members' social, philanthropic, and communal needs.  Through the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Brotherhood, Community, Sephardic Hebrew Center, and their corresponding women's groups joined together in a short-lived Council of Sephardic Organizations, which mainly coordinated fundraising and social events. </p><p>Other Sephardic organizations represented in this collection are the Maccabeans - a semi-independent  young adult group  - and the Sephardic Benevolent Society, alongside the Los Angeles Sephardic Home for the Aged (LASHA) and other local, national, and international Sephardic and Jewish organizations, programs, and groups.</p>  </bioghist>

papers of Richard J. Amado (born 1902 in Smyrna/Izmir, Ottoman Turkey and died 1984 in Los Angeles). Amado was a lawyer and local lay leader in the Sephardic and Jewish community, particularly in the Comunidad/Community and the Council of Sephardic Organizations, where he was president for several years.  Sub-series 1.2 also contains some of Amado's correspondence and other documents relating to his other communal roles from the 1930s through the 1970s.</p></scopecontent><c03
