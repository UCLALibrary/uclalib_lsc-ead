      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>After centuries of established life on the Iberian Peninsula, Jews were formally expelled
        by Spanish royal decree in 1492. With many refugees settling in North Africa and the Ottoman
        Empire, these Jews developed a distinct Sephardic (meaning Spanish, in Hebrew) culture and
        community that included the retention and development of a unique hybrid language, known as
        Judeo-Spanish or Ladino. At the outset of the 20th century, these Sephardic Jews sought
        better futures elsewhere, such as in sub-Saharan Africa, Western Europe, South America, and
        the United States. In search of economic opportunity and respite from political turmoil in
        the crumbling Ottoman Empire, many of these Sephardic Jews found their way to Los Angeles, a
        rapidly growing commercial and industrial metropolis. Throughout the century, the Sephardic
        community in Los Angeles would expand and come to include Jews from various backgrounds,
        notably North African, Israeli, and Persian Jews. By the end of the century, Los Angeles had
        solidified its status as a center of Sephardic life worldwide.</p>
      <p>The Comunidad Sefardi de Los Angeles (Sephardic Community of Los Angeles) was officially
        formed in 1920 by a few dozen young immigrant men, though its roots go back to 1912 with the
        formation of Ahavat Shalom (Love of Peace). Catering to members from cities along Turkey's
        Mediterranean coast - like Istanbul, Bursa, and Izmir - these organizations were
        simultaneously religious, social, cultural, and economic in nature. Soon after in 1921,
        another Sephardic organization, Haim vaHessed (Life and Kindness), was formed and later
        changed its name to the Sephardic Brotherhood. The center of Sephardic life was to be found
        primarily in and around downtown until the 1930s, when it moved southwest towards South Los
        Angeles and the Exposition Park area. The Community's synagogue, Tifereth Israel, was
        inaugurated in 1932 and built on Santa Barbara Avenue, now Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.
        In 1959, a congregational merger created the Sephardic Community and Brotherhood of Los
        Angeles. Beginning in 1967, plans for a new temple in Westwood were underway that were
        ultimately realized during a final dedication ceremony in 1981. Over time, the organization
        and synagogue names would both be identified as the Sephardic Temple Tifereth Israel (STTI),
        as it is known at the time of processing (2019).</p>
      <p>Parallel to and closely intertwined with STTI is another Sephardic congregation in Los
        Angeles that was formed in 1917 as Sociedad Pas i Progreso (Peace and Progress Society) and
        consisted mainly of Jews from the Island of Rhodes. In 1935, after inaugurating a synagogue
        in South Los Angeles at 55th St. and Hoover, they changed their name to the Sephardic Hebrew
        Center. After moving their temple to Ladera Heights in the late 1960s, SHC changed their
        name to Sephardic Beth Shalom in 1992, only to merge with Sephardic Temple Tifereth Israel
        (STTI) in 1993.</p>
      <p>These organizations each had their own women's groups - known as Sisterhoods or Ladies'
        Auxiliaries - that catered to their members' social, philanthropic, and communal needs.
        Through the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Brotherhood, Community, Sephardic Hebrew Center,
        and their corresponding women's groups joined together in a short-lived Council of Sephardic
        Organizations, which mainly coordinated fundraising and social events. </p>
      <p>Other Sephardic organizations represented in this collection are the Maccabeans - a
        semi-independent young adult group - and the Sephardic Benevolent Society, alongside the Los
        Angeles Sephardic Home for the Aged (LASHA) and other local, national, and international
        Sephardic and Jewish organizations, programs, and groups.</p>

            <p>Sub-series 1.2 contains institutional, building, legal, and financial records
              relating to STTI, much of it from the papers of Richard J. Amado (born 1902 in
              Smyrna/Izmir, Ottoman Turkey and died 1984 in Los Angeles). Amado was a lawyer and
              local lay leader in the Sephardic and Jewish community, particularly in the
              Comunidad/Community and the Council of Sephardic Organizations, where he was president
              for several years. Sub-series 1.2 also contains some of Amado's correspondence and
              other documents relating to his other communal roles from the 1930s through the
              1970s.</p>

            <p>Sub-series 1.3 contains material of relevance to the institutions of Sephardic life
              in Los Angeles, such as those related to constitutions and by-laws, membership,
              committees, events, fundraising, and correspondence with other local, national, and
              international organizations. These are mostly from STTI, but some are from the
              Sephardic Sisterhood, the Council of Sephardic Organizations, and the Sephardic Hebrew
              Center.</p>

            Sephardic organizations, from the 1940s until 2017. Most are from the Sephardic
            Community and Brotherhood/STTI, and their <title>El Shofar</title> monthly bulletin
            features a near-complete collection through the 2000s from its first issue in 1980. Its
            long-time editor, Bob Hattem, also served as the STTI main archivist. Other publications
            include those from the Sephardic Hebrew Center and the Los Angeles Sephardic Home for
            the Aged (LASHA). This series also includes items related to cultural, religious, and
            social events and programs organized by or with various Sephardic organizations in Los

          <p>Series 4 contains photographs and scrapbooks from STTI official events and functions,
            as well as those relating to individuals and families associated with the congregation.
            Labeling, condition, and type of photograph and scrapbook vary considerably - some are
            in excellent condition, while others fairly poor. While most items were produced in Los
            Angeles, several originate from New York or Seattle, and still others abroad. The
            scrapbooks in subseries 4.2 contain newspaper clippings from local, national, Jewish,
            and general publications over a considerable date range that relate to STTI or Los
            Angeles Sephardic life, featuring many from the local Jewish publication, <title>B'nai
              B'rith Messenger</title>.</p>
