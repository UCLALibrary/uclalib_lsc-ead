    <head>Expanded Scope and Content</head>
<p>The Archive of the Church of the Brethren comes under the larger heading of the Pacifism Collection; the approximately 3 linear feet contained in the eight boxes of the archive deal less with the work of the Church of the Brethren specifically than with that of the pacifist and conscientious objectors' movement in general during World War II and the years immediately following. The Brethren Service Committee was formed to act in conjunction with other pacifist religious groups and the U.S. government in setting up Civilian Public Service Camps. A total of 11,996 people took part in CPS work during the years 1941-47, 1353 of them Brethren. There were over 100 CPS camps in the U.S., including 10 in California (These and other statistics can be found in the <title type="simple">Director of Civilian Public Service Camps</title>, in Box 2 of the collection). CPS camp projects consisted mainly of conservation and forestry, agricultural experimentation, and hospital and public health work. Projects existed outside the U.S. as well, on a smaller scale, in the short post-war period covered in the collection, the Brethren Service Committee, in particular sponsored projects abroad, with emphasis on public health, relief projects, and social work.</p><p>The major part of this collection (scattered throughout the eight boxes) consists of mimeographed newsletters from various CPS Camps throughout the country. These provide insight into the long-term goals of the pacifist movement as well as its involvement in the temporary CPS projects; and also gives information on the practical aspects of camp life. Besides these CPS newsletters the archive contains many of similar nature put out by the Brethren Service Committee (such as the <title type="simple">BSC Personnel Bulletin</title>, <title type="simple">the BSC Pews</title>, <title type="simple">the BSC Committee Memos</title>, etc.).</p><p>Pamphlets written on specific vocations used in CPS projects, such as mental-hospital work, can be found mainly in Box 6. This box also contains printed matter on pacifism put out for the general public by the Brethren Service Committee. Box 7 contains more such material, including a book by Rufus D. Bowman, Ph.D., president of the Bethany Biblical Seminary, entitled, <title type="simple">The Church of the Brethren and War 1708-1941</title>.</p><p>Boxes 2 and 7 contain correspondence of Robert Vosper, then head of the department of acquisitions at UCLA, and various persons, with regard to the Pacifist Collection. Ephemera on conscientious objectors will be found in Box 8.</p><p>Some issues of the <title type="simple">Tide</title>, a general CPS newsletter, are to be found in Box 2. In the same box are some samples of printed pamphlets from the Untide Press, including poetry by Jacob Sloan, William Everson, and Glen Coffield, pacifist poets. Supposedly a reaction against the prosaism of <title type="simple">Tide</title>, the Untide Press is a product of the CPS camp at Waldport, Oregon, a unique camp dedicated to pacifist expression in the arts.</p>  </scopecontent>
