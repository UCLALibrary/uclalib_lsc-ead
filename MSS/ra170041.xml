    <head>Biography/History</head>
<p>The Rancho San Pedro, also known as the Dominguez Ranch, consisted of 75,000 acres gifted to Juan Jose Dominguez, a Spanish soldier, in 1784. In 1826, Dominguez's nephew, Manuel Dominguez, built an adobe home on the property for his family. Manuel Dominguez and his wife, Maria Engracia Cota, had ten children; six daughters survived, and were all raised in the adobe. The Rancho San Pedro was strategically located during the Mexican War and was the site of major skirmishes; it was also an important stagecoach stop for travelers, conveniently situated between the Pueblo of Los Angeles and the port of San Pedro.</p><p>Don Manuel Dominguez held public office under both the Mexican and U.S. governments in California. Before 1857, he was elected three times as Acalde (Mayor) and Judge of Los Angeles; he later served as a Supervisor for Los Angeles County. He was also selected as a delegate to the convention in Monterey which drew up the first State Constitution.</p>  </bioghist>
