<p>The Lloyd Cotsen cuneiform tablets collection was created from smaller, private collections, acquired over several decades. The tablets in the Cotsen Collection were chosen specifically for their scholastic content. The tablets were integrated into the Cotsen Children's Library Collection housed at Princeton University. In 2011 the Cotsen Institute donated the cuneiform tablet section of the Children's Library to UCLA Special Collections.</p>  </custodhist>

<p>Lloyd E. Cotsen (1929-2017) was a former chief executive officer and chairman of the board of Neutrogena Corporation. Cotsen earned a bachelor's degree in History from Princeton University (1950), served in Navy during the Korean War, and received an MBA from Harvard Business School (1957). He was an avid collector of materials related to folk art, children's literature, and archeology, and accumulated vast collections of Japanese baskets, textiles, children's books, and Chinese mirrors. Over his lifetime he donated portions of his collections to a varity of insitutions, including San Fransico's Asian Art Museum, Princeton Univeristy, and the Museum of International Folk Art in Santa Fe, New Mexico. In 2000 UCLA renamed its Institute of Archaeology the Cotsen Institute of Archaeology.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>This collection provides a comprehensive view of scribal training and writing techniques in the Mesopotamian educational system covering a span of 1600 years. The collection consists of 215 cuneiform tablets (211 school texts and four non-school texts) from Mesopotamia (ancient Iraq). These tablets were written in the Mesopotamian school, the <emph render="italic">eduba</emph> ("House of Tablets"), by students training to become professional scribes, <emph render="italic">dubsar</emph> ("tablet writer"). </p><p>The majority of tablets in this collection date to the Old Babylonian period (c. 1900-1600 BCE), which was known for the development and proliferation of individual scribal schools. In addition to the Old Babylonian texts there are tablets from the Uruk III period (c. 3200-3000 BCE), the Early Dynastic III period (c. 2600-2350 BCE), the Old Akkadian period (c. 2340-2200 BCE), and the Third Dynasty of Ur (c. 2100-2000 BCE). </p><p>School texts cover a rich variety of topics, yet comprise a very small percentage of known cuneiform documents. This collection includes exercises in vocabulary, sign formation, literature, grammar, law, epistles, administration, sealing and stylus practices. These student exercises cover the entire curriculum of scribal training, from the most basic beginner lessons to the advanced lessons of the final stage of education. The wide variety of exercise offers researchers unique insight into the everyday life of the ancient Mesopotamian. </p><p>Typical for the period and genre, the majority of the school texts are written in Sumerian. A few dozen tablets, mostly letters, are written in Akkadian, while a handful of lexical texts contain multiple languages (Sumerian, Akkadian, West Semitic). It is not clear in the remaining tablets, mostly mathematical exercises, which language is being used by the scribe. </p><p>The non-school texts include one legal document from the Early Dynastic period, and three letters written by king Rim-Suen of Larsa (c. 1822-1763 BCE). These royal letters are part of an ancient archive that has since been dispersed across several collections in America and Europe. </p>  </scopecontent>

A crack runs through one of the scrapes and about half way through the side to the opposite face. Another crack at the opposite end of this face also continues onto a side. There is one complete crack on this face; it runs almost through the middle, but it is a very slender crack. The milky-tan face shows the complete crack just described. On one edge there is a fragile bulging point with a deep crack and two small chips that look like they may dislodge. One fragment has already dislodged and has been placed in the storage bag. From this face, a narrow diagonal scrape is visible on the side; it appears to be made by a modern tool, because it does not have the same patina as the rest of the tablet.</physdesc><container id="aspace_31fd45c3b0f5428305aed80d69f7ed23" label="Mixed Materials" type="drawer">5</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="http://www.cdli.ucla.edu/P273852" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="School text, lexical exercise of personal names." xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>School text, lexical exercise of personal names.</p></daodesc></dao></did><scopecontent id="aspace_73f078b9ab6da8a28a9448e63126d4ea"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>This basic student exercise is practice writing personal names.

There is another corner that also appears to have been pressed down, but much less so than the other pressed edge. There is also a scrape mark near this corner on one of the faces. It is unclear if this mark was made while the clay was still wet or after the clay had dried. There are some white concretions visible overall.</physdesc><container id="aspace_5e8854ccb8037c21db3ef56520e66c90" label="Mixed Materials" type="drawer">3</container></did></c01><c01 id="aspace_ref98_qni" level="file"><did><unittitle>School text, lexical exercise of personal names beginning with "lu2".</unittitle><unitid>SC-II-13</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">Old Babylonian Period (c. 1900-1600 BCE)</unitdate><physdesc id="aspace_74f793c9173ae96b5042fc84b06c6bfa" label="General Physical Description note">2 5/8" height x 1 15/16" width x 5/8" depth, rectangular single column tablet</physdesc><physdesc id="aspace_4cd3fdfa613a92653cac0999ad7e8ea0" label="General Physical Description note">Both faces of the tablet were partially wiped smooth while the clay was wet; one face only has inscription in one corner.

About one inch over from the wedge-shaped loss is a second loss; this one is at the edge of another reattached break. Near the edge furthest from the large missing portion of the tablet, there are three shallow gouges, a notched loss, and a deep gouge. Several cracks of varying depths are all over this face. The opposite face shows less damage. There is a deep gouge at one edge- to one side of that is a wedge-shaped loss. Closer toward center of the tablet are two shallower gouges.

There is a gouged loss at one edge of the tablet that adjoins the crack filled with adhesive (described above). The uninscribed face is very fragile with a dry, flaking texture overall. The clay particles in the bag almost certainly flaked from this face. The repaired break in the tablet is visible on this face, and adhesive is present on the surface.

Some writing is preserved along one edge of this face.</physdesc><container id="aspace_9483acdf4062a137621362e8bfc45806" label="Mixed Materials" type="drawer">6</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="http://www.cdli.ucla.edu/P273818" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="School text, lexical exercise." xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>School text, lexical exercise.</p></daodesc></dao></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b4903d206863199f4f44da9400c15396"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>This brief exercise is a student's vocabulary practice.</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 id="aspace_ref799_iwd" level="file"><did><unittitle>School text, lexical exercise of barley.</unittitle><unitid>31719.9</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">Ur III Period (c. 2100-2000 BCE)</unitdate><materialspec id="aspace_08b5a91e5a4b5d91c06f8a626ff0fa31"><lb/>1.

There are minor losses to the surface of both faces. Small, white concretions are visible overall. The tablet is crumbling slightly.</physdesc><container id="aspace_320c8100a84fe9ce97544d04606f8fed" label="Mixed Materials" type="drawer">3</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="http://www.cdli.ucla.edu/P388334" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="School text, lexical exercise from ugu-mu." xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>School text, lexical exercise from ugu-mu.</p></daodesc></dao></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9047fc5c26b76e76da8a9dada8ceb438"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>This tablet is a student's vocabulary practice writing various body parts from the standard Old Babylonian list.</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 id="aspace_ref915_jbs" level="file"><did><unittitle>School text, administrative exercise of payments to workers.</unittitle><unitid>PARS 64</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation">Old Babylonian - Period (c. 1900-1600 BCE)</unitdate><physdesc id="aspace_a71a985ff3003962dc7a3023083025dd" label="General Physical Description note">5" height x 2 5/8" width x 1" depth, baked red rectangular single column tablet joined from fragments with an "X" across obverse</physdesc><physdesc id="aspace_bb5499d88dabd25a0c8ecaf13f410b7d" label="General Physical Description note">Rectangular, flat cuneiform tablet with an area of loss in one corner.

The tablet broke approximately in half, and then one small section broke off of one of the halves. The reattached pieces are badly misaligned, and a large amount of adhesive is applied within breaks and over much of the surface of both faces. On one face, the point where the smallest piece was reattached has a deep gouge on the interior edge; tiny fragments are visible but are heavily glued. A large, gouged crack/loss is at the edge of the tablet where part of the middle- sized reattached piece has been lost. On the largest reattached piece, there is a small deposit of a white-tan colored material near the edge furthest from the repaired breaks. The opposite face shows the same losses to the tablet overall that are described above. Even in the unbroken portion, a large quantity of adhesive covers the face and has run down to the edge of the tablet. A piece of white fiberous material is stuck in the adhesive. Some small, scattered areas on this face are dark gray and appear to be actually saturated with adhesive. There are two areas of tan-colored fill on this face: one is next to where the smallest broken piece is reattached, and the second area is just below the first.The color of the fill blends with the color of the actual clay of the tablet.</physdesc><container id="aspace_189942fca376688ebe877426c5d0c1a6" label="Mixed Materials" type="drawer">5</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="http://www.cdli.ucla.edu/P273851" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="School text, administrative exericse of ration lists." xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>School text, administrative exericse of ration lists.</p></daodesc></dao></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e57b6246dd4f6eaffa10e61996b59dec"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>This basic student practice text contains lists of rations distributed to workers as payment.
