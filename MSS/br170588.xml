    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>This handwritten journal records Brooke's journey from Gravesend, England to Melbourne, Australia aboard the Lord Warden. Composed from October 7, 1873 through February 27, 1874, the daily journal documents events and customs of life on board a ship. The journal begins with a pen and ink drawing of a woman packing Henry Brooke's trunk, and quotes from Othello and Antony and Cleopatra. It appears that Brooke began to create a title page, as the words "13 Weeks on the Lord Warden" are traced in faint pencil on leaf 4r. Brooke mentions sailing customs such as throwing a dead horse overboard, rituals involved with reaching the equator, and Christmas at sea.</p><p>The daily journal ends with Brooke's arrival in Melbourne in January, 1874, though he does append two pages on Melbourne and describes a journey by ship to Launceston, Tasmania. On that journey, he happens to be on the same ship as the "English Eleven" cricketers; he subsequently watches them in a cricket match with a Tasmanian team. Brooke copied the ship's log and the dimensions of the vessel into his journal; he has also transcribed two pieces by fellow passenger A. G. Guillemard (author of <title>Over Land and Sea: A Log of Travel Round the World in 1873-1874</title>): a short essay on the tropics and an account of the playing of cricket onboard the ship. The narrative ends abruptly with Brooke in Tasmania. There are 27 pen and ink illustrations, all of which relate to the material discussed in the journal.</p>  </scopecontent>
