Library Special Collections provides a standard level of preservation and access for all collections and, when time and resources permit, conducts more intensive processing. These materials have been arranged and described according to national and local standards and best practices.</p><p>We are committed to providing ethical, inclusive, and anti-racist description of the materials we steward, and to remediating existing description of our materials that contains language that may be offensive or cause harm.

    <head>Biography/History</head>
<p>Meeting for the first time in West Hollywood in 1987, the Los Angeles chapter of ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) was inspired by the activities of ACT UP New York which had been active throughout that year.</p><p>The Los Angeles chapter focused primarily on improving the access to and quality of AIDS healthcare services, as well as coalition building with a broad range of other activist communities. They advocated for non-violent direct action as a means to draw media attention. The group provided training in civil disobedience and conflict resolution, and support teams were formed to track and respond to confrontations and arrests.</p><p>The Los Angeles chapter defined their organization as a "grass-roots, democratic, militant, direct action organization dedicated to creating positive changes around AIDS in federal and local government, the media and medical industries through non-violent public protests."</p>  </bioghist>
