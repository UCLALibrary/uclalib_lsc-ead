<p>The Valley Music Theatre broke ground in Woodland Hills, CA in January 1964. The 2,865-seat theatre-in-the-round was located at 20600 Ventura Blvd., between Winnetka and Canoga Aves. The goal was to produce and present live musical-dramatic stage productions in the San Fernando Valley. Officers included president Nick Mayo, vice president and treasurer Randolph Hale, and vice president and secretary Art Linkletter. Stockholders included Bob Hope, Danny Thomas, Janet Blair, Marjorie Lord, Ed Begley, and John Raitt, among others. The opening of the theater, on July 7, 1964, featured <title>The Sound of Music</title> as a benefit premiere for the Pi Beta Phi Alumnae Club and affiliated groups of the Crippled Children's Society of Los Angeles County. The productions staged during the theater's tenure were  <title>A Man for All Seasons</title>  (with Charlton Heston), <title>Medea</title>  (with Judith Anderson), and <title>Come Back Little Shea</title>  (with Shirley Booth)  among others. Other actors who performed at the theater include Anna Maria Alberghetti, Eve Arden,  Sidney Blackmer, Janet Blair, Eddie Bracken, Vic Damone, Howard Duff, Buddy Ebsen, Maurice Evans, George Gorshin, Carolyn Jones, Werner Klemperer, Marjorie Lord, Rose Marie, Ethel Merman,  John Myhers, Walter Pidgeon, Vincent Price, Jane Powell, Juliet Prowse,  John Raitt, Mickey Rooney, Walter Slezak, Jack Soo, Rudy Vallee, Jerry Van Dyke, and Gig Young among others.</p><p>In September of 1966, the Los Angeles Times reported The Valley Music Theatre filed bankruptcy. In 1967 attempts were made to sell the theater to the City of Los Angeles, but proposals for the purchase were defeated by the City Council.  Efforts to revive the facility included attractions such as professional boxing matches.  The theater was sold in the 1970s to the Valley congregation of the Jehovah's Witnesses and used as an assembly hall.  It was eventually resold, and in ca. 2007 the Valley Music Theatre was demolished and the site used to construct a luxury apartment complex and work lofts.</p>  </bioghist>
