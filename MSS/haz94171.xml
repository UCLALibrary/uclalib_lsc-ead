    <head>Biography/History</head>
<p>Hazard began compiling his extensive collection of photographs of historical persons and places relating to the history of Los Angeles in the 1880s, which he planned to use in writing his "History of Los Angeles and vicinity." When Hazard died in 1914, Verne Dyson, a writer for the Los Angeles Times and manager of the Pasadena News Bureau, purchased the collection from the Hazard family. Dyson continued to add to the collection, with the intention of finishing and producing Hazard's work. Although Dyson did complete a manuscript (now in the <extref xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:show="new" xlink:href=
"http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt358004g7/">Verne Dyson Papers, 1914-1962 (Collection 804)</extref> in Library Special Collections), and issued a 30-p. prospectus for the work in 1914, it was never published.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>The album contains mainly photographs--both amateur snapshots, most likely by Hazard himself, and stock commercial photographs by such studios as F.H. Maude, Baldwin Foto, and Garden City Foto Company-- as well as printed illustrations removed from other texts, and feature articles from local newspapers on topics related to the history of Los Angeles. Hazard collected many small snapshots of old homes and cottages in what is the downtown area of Los Angeles today, as well as in neighboring cities such as El Monte, Boyle Heights, Pasadena, Huntington Beach, San Pedro, Whittier, Riverside, San Fernando, Redondo Beach, Redlands, Pomona, and Wilmington. Often the homes belong--or once belonged--to early settlers and residents of the area, or to those active in early local government or business, such as the historian J.M. Guinn, Maj. Edwin A. Sherman, Andrés Pico, brother of Pio Pico, Horace Bell, David C. Cook, publisher of religious books, and founder of Piru, and W.H. Workman, Stephen C. Foster, and Henry T. Hazard, all former mayors of Los Angeles. Many of the photos document early Los Angeles streetscapes and buildings, such as the Los Angeles Infirmary--known as the old Sisters Hospital--the first hospital in Los Angeles; cable cars at the top of Bunker Hill on the Second and Spring Street line; the original Raymond Hotel in Pasadena; the Rubio Hotel at the head of the incline railroad leading up to Mt. Lowe in Altadena, early ranchos, such as Rancho Cota in Riverside County, Rancho Camulos, home of Helen Hunt Jackson's Ramona, near Piru, Rancho Palomares in Pomona, Rancho San Joaquín, near Santa Ana, and the Rancho Diego Sepulveda near Palos Verde; and the California missions in San Diego, San Gabriel, San Juan Capistrano, and San Fernando. There are photos from 1907 taken at the ceremony celebrating the 60th anniversary of Fort Moore, built in 1847 by the Mormon Battalion during the Mexican American War. Overall, the photographs provide a wealth of information on local architecture and home decoration of the period, transportation such as horse carriages and trolley cars, clothing and dress, hairstyles, agriculture, and the indigenous peoples of the area. Local industries and businesses are also represented, including a pickle factory, olive mill, saddleries, smelters, bee-keeping, mining, and fishing out of San Pedro. There are interesting photos of social groups such as the Pioneers, and the Ohio state society, of San Bernardino.</p>  </scopecontent>
