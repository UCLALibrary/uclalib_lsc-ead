      <head>Biography/History</head>
      <p>S.A. Griffin (Steven Allan Griffin), born March 16, 1954, is a poet, performance artist,
        publisher, and actor. After graduating from high school in 1972, Griffin voluntarily entered
        the United States Air Force as an administration specialist and was honorably discharged in
        1976. In 1978, Griffin relocated to Los Angeles from San Francisco with a scholarship to
        attend the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera Workshop. Griffin's awards for his work on stage
        and on camera include a Dramalogue Award and a Kari Award.</p>
      <p>In 1982, Griffin became involved with poetry when he began attending open poetry readings
        at the Water Espresso Gallery in Hollywood. During this time he became active in the punk
        scene as a poet and performance artist, appearing at various Southern California venues such
        as The Lhasa Club, Anti-Club, X=Art, Al's Bar, Safari Sam's and Club Lingerie. In the
        mid-1980s, Griffin became directly involved in DIY publishing as a staff member of <title
          render="italic">Shattersheet</title>, and in 1988 he established Rose of Sharon Press with
        the publication of <title render="italic">Sharktalk</title> by Doug Knott. In 1989 Griffin
        was named Best Performance Poet by Wanda Coleman in the <title render="italic">LA
          Weekly</title>.</p>
      <p>In addition to a deep level of involvement in the community through writing, publishing,
        performing, and hosting poetry events, Griffin extensively collected the publications,
        artwork, and related ephemera of Los Angeles poets. These materials relate to Venice West,
        the Los Angeles Beat poetry scene named after the café owned and operated by Stuart Z.
        Perkoff from 1958-1962, and the Denver, Colorado Beat scene to where many Venice West Beats
        migrated. He also collected materials related to influential poets such as d.a. levy, Kurt
        Schwitters, Jack Micheline, Tony Scibella, and Charles Bukowski. With Alan Kaufman, Griffin
        edited <title render="italic">The Outlaw Bible of American Poetry</title> (1999).</p>
      <p>In 1985, Griffin and fellow poets Michael Lane Bruner, Doug Knott, and Mike M. Mollett
        formed The Lost Tribe. From 1985-1988 and in 1992, the group performed poetry in
        choreographed routines both locally and on tour. In 1989, the group underwent a
        philosophical shift and transformed, joined by Scott Wannberg (and occasionally Bobbo Staron
        and Ellyn Maybe), into The Carma Bums, a traveling improvisational performance group. The
        Carma Bums performed until 2009. From 1995-1996, Griffin and punk musician-poets Iris Berry
        and Pleasant Gehman formed White Trash Apocalypse, in Gehman's words, "a spoken word
        tour…treated…like a rock'n'roll tour," which toured the United States and Canada. In 2010,
        Griffin went on tour with The Poetry Bomb, a decommissioned bomb purchased by Griffin and
        filled with poetry at readings throughout the country, intending to "foster
        disagreements…the cornerstone of our democratic system." Since 2007 Griffin has performed
        with the punk-jazz improvisational group The Lofty Canaanites, composed primarily of members
        of Saccharine Trust.</p>
      <p>Griffin studied film acting and cold reading with Jeremiah Comey and performance technique
        with Scot Kelman. From 2005 to 2013, Griffin taught film acting and cold reading at the
        American Film Institute, and since 2012, Griffin has taught film acting and cold reading for
        Jeremiah Comey. Since 2010, Griffin has served on the curatorial board for Beyond Baroque,
        and in 2011 Griffin was the first recipient of Beyond Baroque's Distinguished Service
        Award.</p>
      <p>Griffin continues to live and work in Los Angeles. He is married to Lorraine Perrotta, a
        librarian and veteran member of The L.A. Mudpeople. Griffin has a son, Spencer, from a
        previous marriage to Sharon Grish.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The S.A. Griffin collection of underground poetry, Scott Wannberg, and The Carma Bums
        ranges from circa 1950 to 2015. The collection includes writings by Griffin in manuscript
        and published form; an extensive collection of books, largely related to the Venice West and
        Denver Beat poetry scene, as well as other Beat and Meat School poetry; zines and magazines,
        which are both poetry and punk related and largely published in the greater Los Angeles
        area; and manuscripts of authors Griffin published or befriended. The collection also
        includes clippings and ephemera Griffin collected related to Southern California's punk
        scenes and poetry communities. Correspondence in the collection relates to Griffin's poetry
        work and involvement in the mail art community. The collection also contains files related
        to poetry readings and performances given by Griffin's poetry groups such as The Carma Bums
        which include flyers, road books, and audiovisual recordings. Materials related to Griffin's
        acting career include materials on the Act Fast 5 strike, scripts, and audiovisual
        recordings. The collection includes Griffin's art collection, featuring art by Griffin, Tony
        Scibella, Charles Bukowski, Earl Newman, and many others. Memorabilia in the collection
        includes American flag remnants from d.a. levy's grave, memorial programs, and t-shirts from
        bookstores and bands. The collection also includes the papers of Scott Wannberg, which range
        from circa 1969 to 2014. Bequeathed to Griffin, Wannberg's papers include Wannberg's
        manuscript writings and book collection, correspondence, memorabilia, and artwork.</p>

              <p>Three pages of vows written by Griffin for the wedding of Rob Zabrecky and Tommy at
                the Old Griffith Park Zoo, August 8, 1998. Zabrecky was a member of Possum Dixon, a
                magician and an actor. Griffin met Rob through Pleasant Gehman when they did a gig
                at the Pik Me Up Cafe around 1992. Griffin tailors the ceremonies to suit the couple
                even these vows have not fundamentally changed since he performed his first wedding
                in 1995 for Eric Brown and Tori Williams. According to Griffin, each set of vows is

            <p>Serials featuring Griffin's writings, which include serials that he published, have
              been organized alphabetically by title of publication.</p>

            <head>Biography/History</head>
            <p>The first publication Griffin worked with was <title render="italic"
                >Shattersheet</title>, edited and published by Jim and April Burns out of the
              Valley. Jim walked into Al's one night giving away free issues to introduce the zine
              to everyone. Mike Bruner and Griffin responded immediately and volunteered to do
              whatever Jim wanted. <title render="italic">Shattersheet</title> was important because
              not only did it publish poetry, but it was the first publication, to Griffin's
              knowledge, that published a fairly comprehensive listing of poetry events in and
              around Southern California. Just previous to this Griffin had worked at Medicus, a
              local printing broker. With Jim and April, wanting to learn everything he could about
              DIY/small press, Griffin did much of the same tasks: cut and paste, inputting on the
              ancient Mac used primarily for word processing, collating/folding, distribution,
              collections, and some editing. Working with <title render="italic"
                >Shattersheet</title> Griffin got to know the local community and became very
              familiar with Scott Wannberg's work long before they met and became friends.
              Wannberg's book <title render="italic">The Electric Yes Indeed!</title>, officially
              published by Shelf Life Press and with initial editing and publishing by Jim, became
              the second book Griffin had published.</p>
            <p>As <title render="italic">Shattersheet</title> was waning, <title render="italic">The
                Moment</title> was on its way up, in Griffin's opinion inspired by the local success
              of <title render="italic">Shattersheet</title>. <title render="italic">The
                Moment</title> was edited and published by Kevin Bartnof, Chris Behling and Eric
              Lyden, who were more Gonzo in their approach. With <title render="italic">The
                Moment</title>, Griffin was introduced to a deeper Beat dynamic, and in time was
              introduced to Allen Ginsberg and Jack Micheline, among others. In Griffin's words,
              "the Carma Bums got directly plugged into <title render="italic">The Moment</title>
              since we fit directly into what it was they were all about."</p>
            <p>Griffin became friends with Rafael FJ Alvarado, a regular of the old Onyx, when he
              disrupted a reading that Griffin was conducting at The Onyx Cafe on Vermont.
              Eventually, Alvarado and Griffin would publish and edit <title render="italic">(Sic)
                Vice &amp; Verse</title>, first as the broadside <title render="italic">(Sic) Random
                Vice &amp; Verse</title>, then as a periodical. Griffin worked directly with Michael
              Simmons and Rachel Kusher.</p>

              <p>Lou Mensch, the owner, booked The Carma Bums for a gig on that year's tour at
                Father's Office, and also gave them a few bucks to land and eat somewhere. According
                to Griffin, back then Father's Office had sawdust on the floor and folks were still
                smoking cigarettes. The Carma Bums hung out there a lot in the late 1980s and early
                1990s drinking pitchers of Grant's Russian Imperial Stout. They played Spades
                endlessly while they talked and planned (at times).</p>

              <p>The Poems-For-All (PFA) project began in March 2001 with the publication of The
                Bells of The Cherokee Ponies by poet and small press publisher d.a. levy who sparked
                what became known as The Mimeograph Revolution, which involves outsiders and
                underground writers publishing on their own terms by any means possible. Richard
                Hansen describes the PFAs as "Little books, scattered like seeds. That is, they're
                given away, left around, thrown about the place for people to find. Free. Always

            <p>The monographs, which are organized alphabetically by last name, largely relate to
              the Venice West and Denver Beat poetry scene, other Beat poetry, and underground
              poetry from the greater Los Angeles area which include Charles Bukowski's own
              collection of foreign editions of his work, which Linda Bukowski gave to Griffin. Many
              of the monographs are small press or independently published chapbooks.</p>
            <p>Books from S.A. Griffin's library that were originally donated with the papers have
              been individually cataloged in the UCLA Library online catalog. Records for these
              items may be found by searching the Special Coll/Archive SPAC "SALA" using the
              Advanced search tab in the Library catalog, or keyword searching "Books from the
              Library of S.A. Griffin".</p>

              <p>Bob Flanagan was a poet, performance artist and Modern Primitive pioneer who
                influenced Griffin as a poet and performance artist. Flanagan was a long time
                facilitator for Beyond Baroque's Wednesday night writing workshop. When Flanagan
                passed away, Griffin went to the open poetry reading at Beyond Baroque where he was
                spanked while he read as tribute to Flanagan's poetry and performance.</p>

              <p>This zine by Misti Rainwater-Lites combines porn and poetry. In her letter from the

                Meat) getting sucked off by Courtney Love. It doesn't get much more exciting than
                that."</p>

              <p>This Gonzo type Los Angeles DIY Xerox poetry/lit zine from the late 1980s-mid 1990s
                was edited and published by San Fernando Valley poets Kevin Bartnof, Chris Behling
                and Eric Lyden. Like <title render="italic">Shattersheet</title> just before it,
                  <title render="italic">The Moment</title> included listings of venues and
                readings. When Griffin met editor Eric Lyden at a Poeccentric Lounge reading in
                downtown L.A., Lyden recruited him to submit poetry and Griffin then volunteered to
                work on staff doing whatever was needed.</p>

              <p>According to Griffin, this zine was created and distributed randomly by Eric Brown
                and a group referred to as the Nadeau crowd because many of them lived in a house at
                the end of Nadeau Court in South Central Los Angeles. Many members were UCLA or USC
                film students, artists, and writers. <title render="italic">Rats</title> was a DIY
                zine created by the group. Everyone contributed anonymously. Griffin, Scott
                Wannberg, and Mike M. Mollett were a few of the contributors. The Nadeau crew
                ultimately evolved into the core of Los Angeles Cacophony when Rev Al arrived on the
                scene.</p>

                pranksters providing an escape hatch for people caught up in the grid of modern
                life. The Cacophony Society has no rules and no leaders. You may already be a

              <p>Griffin met Jack Brewer at an X=Art show that they were both booked on and have
                remained friends. For many years Brewer would improvise on guitar while Griffin
                worked the words. Brewer created The Lofty Canaanites sometime in the early 2000s,
                an improvisational punk/jazz band with Joe Baiza, Steve Reed, and Bob Lee with
                Brewer and Griffin as the front men. Bob Lee was replaced by Brian Christopherson
                for future incarnations.</p>

              <p>Michael Lane Bruner is a friend of Griffin's who he met at The Water Espresso
                Gallery during the early 1980s in Hollywood. Bruner, Griffin, Doug Knott, and Mike
                M. Mollett created The Lost Tribe. Later, with Bobbo Staron and Scott Wannberg, they
                reformed as The Carma Bums. Still working together, most recently as The Lost Bums
                (Bruner, Griffin, Knott, and Mollett) they created a CD of readings and spontaneous
                raps produced by Bruner <title render="italic">The Lost Bums: Ozark
                  Revelations</title> (2016) and forthcoming <title render="italic">The Hideous
                  Bible</title> (Rose of Sharon). Griffin published and edited Bruner's book <title
                  render="italic">Natural Geographics</title> (Rose of Sharon) in 2014. Bruner is
                now the head of admissions at Georgia State University. While working towards his
                double Masters at the University of Washington, Seattle in 1994, Bruner would bring
                The Carma Bums into the new frontier of the Internet via the tech department at the
                university resulting in The Carma Bums International Superhighway Tour of Words,
                considered the first poetry website of its kind featuring original writing, graphic
                images, and hyperlinks.</p>

                broadside, cum magazine published and edited by Rafael FJ Alvarado and S.A. Griffin.
                Originally a broadside, in time becoming an alt lit poetry, art, lit, music magazine
                in 1998 with hook or crook distribution around the country. Alvarado and Griffin had
                a falling out over the magazine after the 8th issue when Griffin gave it all to him.
                Griffin completed the editing for the 9th issue without credit before his

              <p>Tony Scibella and S.A. Griffin took a trip to the Cannabis Cup in 1998, in
                Griffin's words, "to be in the one place on Earth where smoking pot was openly
                celebrated." Scibella and Griffin stayed at the Lucky Mother's Inn and had (Sic)
                Vice &amp; Verse journalist identification cards made to try to crash the Cup. They
                failed to get in, but when they did make it to the free to public Cannabis Cup pot
                expo with the identification displayed, many of the attendees were convinced that
                they were Feds from the United States. Since neither had the money to pay for passes
                to the Cup, they ended up spending the majority of their time walking around
                Amsterdam stoned, or hanging at the Lucky Mother's where Scibella shared tales of
                his beatnik glory.</p>

              <p>According to Griffin, Charles Bukowski was an early, important, and lasting

              <p>Performance poetry group created by S.A. Griffin in the summer of 1989 after a trip
                to Denver where he was on location as a guest star for a Perry Mason movie of the
                week <title render="italic">Case of The All Star Assassin</title>. The Carma Bums
                were conceived to only exist on the road as part poetry, performance, Dada and a lot
                improv / happening. The original group was Michael Lane Bruner, S.A. Griffin, Doug
                Knott, Bobbo Staron, and Scott Wannberg. They invited Laurel Ann Bogen to be part of
                the original group, but according to Griffin she declined, saying that she'd "done
                her time sleeping on floors." They brought on Ellyn Maybe to open for them. Mike M.
                Mollett joined the group in 1990. Bobbo Staron dropped out after 1992. The Carma
                Bums toured the U.S. and Canada, 1989-2009. In 1994 they travelled to the University
                of Washington, Seattle for a week to create The Carma Bums International
                Superhighway Tour of Words. The Carma Bums mostly toured in Griffin's 1959 Cadillac
                Farther. The group disbanded after Scott Wannberg's death on August 19, 2011. The
                Carma Bums are the subject of the documentary <title render="italic">The Luxurious

              <p>Allen Ginsberg was a Beat poet 20th century icon. In the late 1980s Griffin asked
                Ginsberg what he thought poetry might be. After about three hours of discussion
                while waiting for his plane at LAX the conclusion was: candor. Griffin believes,
                "Ginsberg changed the world with his public reading of Howl, its subsequent
                publication and landmark trial. There is no Beat movement without him."</p>

              <p>Spencer Griffin is Griffin's only child by his second wife, Sharon Grish Griffin.
                Spencer was born in Santa Monica, California on December 29, 1987 and diagnosed as
                autistic by Dr. BJ Freeman (UCLA) in 1990. Griffin's brother and sister Robin and
                Robert were diagnosed as "mentally retarded" when they were about 1-2 years old, and
                it was later suggested that they were more than likely misdiagnosed at the time,
                both of them quite possibly on the autism spectrum. When Dr. Freeman explained to
                the Griffins why she considered Spencer to be autistic, Griffin believed he too must
                be autistic. Sharon and S.A. have since concluded that Spencer has Asperger's.
                Griffin is deeply proud of his son, who graduated from Village Glen High School in
                Sherman Oaks, attended Glendale Community College and Pasadena City College, and
                received his AA from American River College. Spencer received his BA from UC Davis
                in 2015 with a major in linguistics. He plays guitar and writes music and poetry.
                Griffin published <title render="italic">When Is The Future?</title> (Rose of
                Sharon, 1997) for him when he was ten years old.</p>

                which included Bob Branaman, Bruce Conner, Stan Brakhage and Dave Haselwood. Griffin

                innocent but not stupid. Non-verbal and often silent. Slow-moving and deliberate,
                discovering wonderful moments in the places most people by-pass, overlook or step
                thru [sic]. Mudpeople are liberated without the concept of time, hurry and stress.
                Mudpeople live in contrast to a frenetic world." Over the years, the group's
                membership has included aerobics instructors, artists, actors, publishers,
                gardeners, teachers, access cable hosts, George and Peggy DiCaprio, and Griffin's

                cover features an original silk-screened rabbit created by Tom Kryss for the books
                and the images were screened in Jake and Cindy Marx's front room in Cleveland. The
                rabbit is Kryss's signature image, a symbol of "rabbits everywhere" reflecting
                levy's ethic to "cover the city (of Cleveland) with lines (of poetry)" in service of
                this cultural revolution.</p>

              <p>Jack Micheline was a poet and artist who was part of the San Francisco Beat
                Renaissance. His first book, <title render="italic">River of Red Wine</title>
                (1958), contains a forward written by Jack Kerouac. Griffin met Micheline through
                his association with The Moment and ended up producing some of his last shows in Los
                Angeles. <title render="italic">The Outlaw Bible of American Poetry</title> happened
                because of Micheline's passing. A Beat poet and street poet, Micheline is also
                considered an "outlaw" poet. Micheline was a friend of A.D. Winans and Bob Kaufman.
                After Micheline's death, Winans worked with the city of San Francisco to name a
                street after Micheline. <title render="italic">Give America A Break: A Tribute To

              <p>Shanna Baldwin-Moore is a Venice Beat poet and a collagist, one of the original
                Venice Beats. A Washington state native, in 1956 after graduating high school she
                migrated to Southern California where she lived and attended Pasadena City College.
                Eventually Baldwin-Moore moved to Venice where she met Venice West poet James Ryan
                Morris at the Carousel, a gay bar on the Venice Boardwalk where Jimmy scored drugs.
                In 1961 Baldwin-Moore relocated to Seattle with Morris, where she gave birth to
                their daughter Danette (Leos) Costello. According to Baldwin-Moore, Morris began
                public drug debates with Timothy Leary in Seattle. The debates ultimately took
                Morris to Denver around 1965 where he met Diana, whom he married. Soon after Morris
                settled in Denver, many of the Venice West poets followed him there, where the
                Venice West Beat scene continued to flourish. Morris died in Denver in 1978. In
                1970, Baldwin-Moore moved to Hawaii, where, as of 2016, she still writes.</p>

              <p>Todd Moore was a Southwestern poet and writer originally from Illinois. Moore
                dedicated much of his poetic life to writing his John Dillinger opus. During an
                interview with Griffin for an Onword podcast, Moore claimed that his Dillinger opus
                was about three-quarters of a million words. Moore has his own section in the <title
                  render="italic">Outlaw Bible of American Poetry</title> edited by Griffin. A few
                years after the publication of the Outlaw Bible in 2004, Moore and fellow New Mexico
                poet Tony Moffeit established what they called the "outlaw" school of poetics. In
                the aforementioned podcast interview Moore stated that the<title render="italic">
                  Outlaw Bible</title> influenced the establishment of outlaw poetics. Moore was a
                cornerstone and regular contributor to The Outlaw Poetry Network (France) online.
                Moore was a friend who, according to Griffin, had one of the biggest and most
                important Bowie knife collections in the world.</p>

              <p>James Ryan Morris (aka Jimmy, JRM, Jimbo) was a Beat poet who joined Tony Scibella
                and others in the 1960s as part of the Venice West Writers Group in California. In
                1967, soon after Morris settled in Denver, many of the Venice West poets followed
                him there, where the Venice West Beat scene continued to thrive. While in Denver,
                Morris wrote and performed poetry, dabbled in publishing and put out The Mile High
                Underground, an alternative newspaper. When Morris died in Denver in 1978, his
                funeral was held at Dory Hill Cemetery near Black Hawk where Scibella and Frank T.
                Rios presided at the free-form ceremony. According to the Denver Post, friends of
                Morris and mourners at the ceremony said that in spite of the apparent causes, "what
                killed Morris was society's declination to support writers and artists."</p>

              <p>Around 1981, Griffin spent a year of his life running with cast of <title

                show directed and produced by Alan Graham. Graham was married to Jim Morrison's
                sister Anne at the time. Dave Brock, the show's lead Morrison, still tours and
                performs as Jim Morrison. The show brought Griffin into the world of Jim Morrison
                and the Doors and provided him with a world-class education. The cast appeared in a
                promo on an early segment of MTV backing Jamie Seagal (Janis Joplin) singing Ball
                &amp; Chain.<title render="italic"> Morrison: The Rock Opera</title> opened and ran
                for about a week at Gazzari's on The Sunset Strip. During that year Griffin spent
                much time with Jimy Graham who portrayed Jimi Hendrix in the show. After the show
                broke up, Jimy became a member of The Babylon Warriors.</p>

              <p>The Onyx Echo, 1866 Glendale Blvd., 1992-1994</p>
              <p>The Onyx Cafe was open close to 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The Onyx was owned
                and operated by John Leech who first opened it with his partner, Fumiko Robinson.
                Griffin curated a number of poetry series at the Onyx Sequel including Angina and
                Slow Train and debuted his video/performance <title render="italic">Act of
                  Kindness</title> there. Griffin produced and staged Open Ended It performances,
                which included Jack Kerouac's Birthday Party, at the Echo. Beck was an Onyx regular
                and used to open for some of the poetry shows. Owner John Leech said that his goal
                with the Onyx was to create a venue to promote art and artists, as well as create a
                meeting space. The following were some of the artist regulars: Gronk, Anthony
                Ausgang, Van Arno, Louis Metz, Barry Markowitz, Stacey Lande, Andy Takakjian, Steve
                LaPonsie, Manuel A Campo and Lucas Reiner. Additionally, poet Steve Abee, musician
                Michael Whitmore, performance artist Mo Figuls, and artist Stacy Lande were a few
                who worked there over the years. Michael Whitmore and Michael Carpenter assisted
                Leech with the cafe's daily operations. Leech was a friend and surrogate father to
                many who called the Onyx home. At Thanksgiving and Christmas, Leech would close the
                doors and open to the regulars, providing a free feast for all. There were also many
                backyard BBQs behind The Onyx on Vermont. The Onyx closed in 1998. Griffin attempted
                to produce an Onyx reunion a number of times, but Leech refused to allow it.
                Finally, in 2008, Leech agreed to allow Griffin to produce a ten-year anniversary
                gathering on October 11, 2008 at the Tribal Cafe in Echo Park, owned and operated by
                Joshua Jose, a former regular at The Onyx. When Leech passed away in March 2009, his
                memorial was held at the Tribal Cafe.</p>

              <p>Griffin co-edited this book with Alan Kaufman. This book happened as a result of
                Griffin's relationship with San Francisco Beat poet Jack Micheline. When Micheline
                passed away, Griffin eulogized him in his Onword column for <title render="italic"
                  >Damaged Goods</title>, a Los Angeles based underground / small press lit-poetry
                serial edited and published by Tracy Lee Williams. The piece was picked up and
                published online at BookZen.com, where another friend of Micheline's, Alan Kaufman,
                read it and then began an email correspondence with Griffin. During the course of
                their correspondence Griffin said that he had always wanted to create an "anthology
                of California poets like Jack who never got their due in life." Alan responded, "Me
                too," and they were on. Kaufman had a connection with a literary agent who pitched
                the project which was then picked up by Neil Ortenberg at Thunders Mouth Press in
                New York. Ortenberg's only caveat was that the project had to be an anthology
                covering the national scene with six weeks to create it from start to finish. The
                book ended up taking over a year to execute online via email and telephone with
                Griffin in Los Angeles, Kaufman in San Francisco, and Ortenberg in New York.</p>

              <p>Pipeline Theatre is where Griffin saw Susan Block (now sexologist Dr. Susan Block),
                Wanda Coleman, and Bob Flanagan perform together. According to Griffin, this was a
                seminal experience for him where Coleman and Flanagan's performance revolutionized
                his thinking and showed him what was possible with the performance of poetry. Owned
                and operated by Scott Kelman, The Pipeline would later move and reestablish itself
                as the Wallenboyd at the corner of Wall &amp; Boyd streets in downtown Los Angeles.
                Kelman wrote, directed and produced performance and theatre, and also taught
                performance there. Kelman taught and directed John Fleck, Kedric Robin Wolfe, The
                Lost Tribe, and Deborah Oliver. Mike Bruner worked directly with Kelman as his
                assistant director before Bruner moved to Louisiana for academic pursuits. Through
                Griffin's performance study with Scott Kelman, he received the mantra of process:
                deliberation and empathy.</p>

              <p>Frank T. Rios is a Venice West Beat poet and collagist. Originally from the Bronx,
                Rios was on the run when he hitchhiked to Venice in 1954 and stayed with a few
                friends. He returned to New York, did some time, got involved in the poetry scene in
                the Village, and then returned to Venice in 1959 where he formed a poetic alliance
                and lifelong friendship with Stuart Z. Perkoff and Tony Scibella (The Holy Three,
                The Secret Six). Rios lives with his wife Joyce Castagnola in Los Angeles.</p>

              <p>Shatterproof was a DIY-Xerox small press operation founded in the San Fernando
                Valley by poets Jim and April Burns. Shattersheet was a poetry serial that covered
                the Southern California scene during the 1980s. Published and edited by Jim and
                April Burns, Shattersheet was a seminal publication that not only published up and
                coming poets alongside established and well known poets but also was the first
                periodical of its kind to include listings of poetry and performance venues. Griffin
                volunteered and worked on staff doing cut and paste-up, editing, collating/folding,
                distribution, and collections. Shatterproof is where Griffin's own publishing and
                editing began.</p>

              <p>Gary Christopherson (Chris, Slim Chance) was the bass player for Mad Daddys and The
                Cramps. When Lorraine Perrotta and Griffin started dating in February 1991,
                Christopherson and his wife Barbara Burns were Perrotta's roommates on Lexington
                Avenue in West Hollywood, where Griffin officiated Chris and Barbara's marriage some
                years later. After leaving The Cramps, Christopherson never played in another band.
                As of 2016, he has been working as a mail carrier for the United States Postal
                Service (USPS).</p>

              <p>Lon Spiegelman was a mail artist, Fluxist, Dadaist, artist, and friend who
                influenced Griffin's work. Griffin's first mail art party was at Spiegelman's place
                on Elevado in Silver Lake, which included Mike M. Mollett (who rented a room in
                Lon's house), Richard Meade, Leslie Caldera (Creative Thing) and others. Griffin's
                mail art name at the time was Cowboy Steve. In time he began using the Dada "X"
                which he co-opted from Kurt Schwitters' Merde as "SA/DA/DA/DA."</p>

              <p>Griffin met Bobbo Staron at The Water Espresso Gallery during the Wednesday night
                open readings. Griffin performed with Staron on countless shows from the mid 1980s
                into the early 1990s and produced his album <title render="italic">My Name Is
                  Trouble</title> (ROS-101, 1989). Staron was also one of the founding members of
                the Carma Bums in 1989. Staron, a friend of Griffin's wife Lorraine Perrotta from
                Spotswood, New Jersey, introduced Griffin and Perrotta at a wedding on the Queen
                Mary in Long Beach in September 1990. However, Griffin was still married at the time
                and thought nothing of it. Through a series of circumstances, which sprung from a
                poetry performance Griffin's at a downtown loft, the two met months later in
                February 1991 after he had separated from his second wife Sharon Grish in September
                1990 and had moved into his apartment at 2053 N. Vermont Avenue.</p>

              <p>Red (Shalom Stodolsky) owned and operated Baroque Book Store (1972-1998) at 1643 N.
                Las Palmas Avenue just south of Hollywood Boulevard. Baroque Book Store was referred
                to as the "University of Red's" by some poets and customers, and Red as "Brooklyn
                Red" by his friend Charles Bukowski. Red was friend and bookman mentor to Griffin.
                Griffin met Red in the early 1980s when Griffin went looking for books by and about
                the Beats and Charles Bukowski. With some monetary assistance from his friend Z
                (Mark Zarem) Griffin designed and created a bronze plaque to honor Red and the
                bookstore. The plaque was placed on the outside wall on what would have been Red's
                95th birthday, May 21, 2011.</p>

              <p>Andy Takakjian is an artist, graphic artist, writer, and publisher (Atmus). Griffin
                first met him when Takakjian was living in Orange County. A longtime friend,

                  Legged Man Standing Casually On Hollywood Blvd. Smoking A Cigarette</title>.
                Takakjian was deeply involved in the Onyx Cafe creating art, flyers, and signage for
                many functions, and he also contributed as an artist and graphic designer for many

              <p>Venice West is an association given to the artists, musicians, and poets who lived
                in Venice, California during the 1950s-1960s when it was a "Slum by the Sea." Venice
                West was created by Abbott Kinney in the late 19th century to become a "beach
                community that would foster a cultural renaissance...on the shores of the Pacific,"
                which he modeled after Venice, Italy. The Temple of Man is a non-profit started by
                Robert "Baza" or "Bob" Alexander (1923-1987) in San Francisco, California in 1960 as
                a center for "poetry, jazz and art." The Temple of Man moved to Venice, California
                in 1968 and still thrives in Los Angeles with a national membership. Poet and writer
                Ed Ward of Denver wrote a piece detailing the genesis of the Temple of Man wherein
                he recalls Stuart Z. Perkoff's incarceration, "a friend of Stuart's, the
                artist/poet/printer Robert Alexander, visited the prison [the Penitentiary at
                Terminal Island] but was told that visitors - other than family (father, son,
                brother, wife, etc) or chaplains - were not allowed. And so for this very pragmatic
                reason - among other less pragmatic reasons such as his interest in art, poetry,
                community and ritual - Baza founded The Temple of Man in 1960, a non-profit
                religious organization. To visit an incarcerated friend."</p>

              <p>A founding member of the Carma Bums who spent most of his life working at Dutton's
                Books in Brentwood, Scott Wannberg was a prolific poet who employed surrealism, wit,
                humor, irony, history, music, and politics in his work. He cited Walt Whitman,
                Charles Bukowski, and William Carlos Williams as major poetic influences. He also
                mentored many younger poets and writers. His interests in music, history, and cinema
                were accompanied with encyclopedic knowledge of them. He would often write poems for
                visiting authors on reading tours coming through Dutton's and created
                correspondences with many writers including historian Page Smith, with whom he was
                close. His mentors at San Francisco State were Stan Rice and Daniel J. Langton.</p>
              <p>Griffin and Wannberg began their close friendship sometime in 1987. Griffin
                published Wannberg's second book <title render="italic">The Electric Yes
                  Indeed!</title> (1989), and continued publishing Wannberg's work until 2009 when
                Perceval Press began publishing Wannberg's work beginning with <title
                  render="italic">Strange Movie Full of Death</title>. Wannberg was friends with
                many of the film celebrities, recording artists, directors and writers who
                frequented Dutton's. Director and writer David O. Russell wrote the part of Bic
                Shottinger for him in <title render="italic">I Heart Huckabees</title>. Ed Harris
                gave him the part of Fat Wallis in <title render="italic">Appaloosa</title>, but
                Wannberg's health prevented him from participating.</p>
              <p>Wannberg's deteriorating health, Dutton's closing, the death of both of his
                parents, and struggling finances all contributed to Scott relocating in August of
                2008 near his uncle Kenneth Wannberg, a music editor and film composer, in Florence,
                Oregon, where he passed away three years later in August 2011.</p>

              <p>The Water, owned by artist Frederick Sauls and managed by Bill Murphy, was located
                at 1110 N. Hudson Avenue with its entrance on Santa Monica Boulevard. This was the
                first place where Griffin read poetry in public outside of an academic setting.
                Responding to an ad in Dramalogue, Griffin began attending the Wednesday night open
                readings at The Water sometime in 1981. The Water was across the street from the Kit
                Kat Klub, a strip club that during the punk era doubled as a performance venue for
                acts like The Red Hot Chili Peppers. The Water was part of a complex in the arts
                building owned by Sauls that also housed The Lhasa Club and The Figtree Theatre. At
                the time, there were very few places to read poetry for those involved in what could
                be called the alternative or underground poetry scene, which is why these poets
                often opened for bands, or read between bands as they set up. Griffin met the future
                members of The Lost Tribe and Bobbo Staron at the Water. Other Wednesday night open
                reader/performers included Leah Really, Linda Sibio, Alan Pulner, Jimmy Townes,
                Johnny Forever, Janet Klein, Steve Wolfe, Salmon Murphy, and Ben Downing. The
                Wednesday night open was originally hosted by a soft-spoken man named Benjamin who
                didn't last long after attendance began to increase. The hosting duties were picked
                up by Ben Downing, a gentle giant of a man who had come to Los Angeles to be an
                actor. Tired of struggling to make ends meet as an actor, Downing returned to his
                home in Arkansas where he worked as a journalist. Griffin continued to correspond
                with Downing until he received a letter from Ben's mother in which she shared that
                Ben had been struck and killed by a car as they were walking down the road together.
                After Downing, the evenings were hosted by Leah Really and then Doug Knott. About
                this time, Knott began producing and hosting a long running series of punk variety
                shows at The Lhasa Club called "Doug Knott Presents."</p>

              <p>Saul White (1932-2003) was a Venice West abstract expressionist and jazz poet. Born
                in New York, White moved to Los Angeles in 1945 and attended Fairfax High where he
                befriended Wallace Berman who was considered by many to be an artistic and spiritual
                center of the Venice West scene. After serving during the Korean War, White attended
                Otis Art Institute on a fellowship. In the mid 1950s he rented a storefront in
                Venice on Ocean Avenue that became a gathering place for artists including Edward
                Kienholz and John Altoon. In 1957 White was part of a series of readings with
                Kenneth Patchen and Kenneth Rexroth at the Los Angeles Jazz Concert Hall,
                accompanied by Shorty Rogers' jazz band. White relocated to New York in 1958 where
                he became a fixture in the Greenwich Village art scene. There he met and became
                friends with Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline. In the early 1960s White was invited
                to live and work with de Kooning in East Hampton where he helped build de Kooning's
                studio. In time he returned to Los Angeles. Producing work to the end, Saul had a
                studio in San Pedro where he left behind a legacy of work. His son Aaron White, by
                his former wife and artist Michele White, is an artist living in Denver.</p>

              <p>Iris Berry (Bikini Atoll Berry Gabor), Pleasant Gehman (Gamma Ray Gehman Gabor) and
                S.A. Griffin (Sunny Meltdown Riviera) came together in October 1995 to create
                performance poetry ensemble White Trash Apocalypse (WTA). According to Griffin,
                Berry and Gehman wanted to go on the road and decided that he should be the third
                wheel and the driver. The group name was derived from a poem of the same name by
                Gehman. Berry and Gehman donned their rhinestone tiaras and faux leopard coats while
                Griffin wore vintage polyester and bright colored Hush Puppies. Joining them on
                their 1995 tour as their official photographer was Gehman's boyfriend at the time
                Jeffoto (Snaps Reactor), who had relocated from Boston to be a part of the Carma
                Bums' 1991 Nowhere Tour of Words and never left. S.A. Griffin drove his burgundy
                1971 Buick Riviera for the White Trash Apocalypse Words On Wheels 1995 Tour of
                Words. WTA jokingly referred to themselves as "The Veets," a pun marrying Velveeta
                cheese and The Beats to reflect their goal as poets and performers to reach the
                "highest cheese possible." WTA opened for The Geraldine Fibbers at the Hotel
                Congress in Tucson, Arizona. Partying in the hotel after the gig, they were given
                their mission by one of the Fibbers to find the "Hope Rhinestone" which they
                stumbled upon at the Liberace Museum in Las Vegas, Nevada. The trio continued to
                perform together and tour as White Trash Apocalypse throughout 1995-1996.</p>

              <p>F.N. Wright (1940-2012) was a Los Angeles poet, artist, and writer. Among his most
                well known books is <title render="italic">Whorehouse</title> (1978), a memoir based
                on his time working for Wherehouse Records. German translator and literary agent
                Carl Weissner, who represented Charles Bukowski, also translated and represented
                Wright. Wright, an Illinois native and Navy veteran of the Vietnam War, was an avid
                biker all his life and was considered an "outlaw" poet and writer. He lived the last
                years of his life in a trailer park close to the Rock Store in Cornell where family
                and friends held his memorial. A friend of Kenneth and Miriam Patchen, Wright wrote
                much of his work on Kenneth's typewriter, given to him by Miriam after her husband's
                death, and Griffin sees Kenneth's, influence reflected in Wright's art. Wright and
                Griffin were friends the last few years of Wright's life, reading together at Beyond
                Baroque.</p>

            <p>BeBop Records was owned and operated by Richard Bruland and Rene Engel. BeBop Records
              was located across the street from The Country Club in Reseda. According to Griffin,
              during its operation (1982-1990), BeBop was one of the premiere punk, poetry and
              performance venues in the Los Angeles area. The first band to play there was Los
              Lobos. In August 1989 The Carma Bums performed there for the first time anywhere.
              After the show, The Bums loaded up the '59 Cadillac outside the front door of BeBop,
              baptized it with a bottle of Coca-Cola across the bow and then hit the road for their
              Carma Bums 1989 No Seat Belts Tour of Words to Denver, Colorado where the idea for the
              Bums was born.</p>

              shirts for our 1991 Start From Zero Secret Tour of Words where the Bums toured
              Southern California/San Diego/Tiajuana with 30 people following them. The pot smoking
              Cadillac (which is the perimeter of the piece) was part of the flyer created for the
              Bums by artist Stuart Ellis for their 1989 No Seat Belts Tour of Words. Dale
              Sedenquist created the caricatures and placed them in the middle along with the text.
              The other side is a flyer from one of the shows signed by The Carma Bums and many of
              those that followed them throughout the tour. This piece was framed by L.A.

            <p>The Electronic Cafe was founded in 1984 by Kit Galloway and Sherrie Rabinowitz,
              operating out of the 18th Street Arts Complex in Santa Monica. The Carma Bums did a
              broadcast there on New Year's 1990. Griffin did a few solo shows out of the Electronic
              Cafe that reached Europe and the Biosphere. Galloway and Rabinowitz were community
              supporters of small press and performance artists regionally and worldwide.</p>

            <p>During this performance, Griffin and his crew invaded George Herms' art class. Herms
              was not there but showed up at the end. Griffin was inspired in part by Breton wherein
              he had the L.A. Mudpeople deliberating while the artists drew the poets writing and
              the poets wrote about the artists capturing them so that everyone absorbed the entire
              event as art and words.</p>

            <p>This poetry performance group was created in 1985 by Michael Lane Bruner, S.A.
              Griffin, Doug Knott, and Mike M. Mollett. The formation of the group emerged out of
              the Wednesday night open readings at The Water Espresso Gallery, as a response to the
              punk expression and performance happening at the time. A well-rehearsed, crack
              performance ensemble complete with costumes, props, and only one rule: no work
              performed was written for performance. The Tribe only choreographed and performed work
              written as poetry for the page. The Tribe's stated goal was to elevate poetry to
              something more accessible as entertainment. The Lost Tribe appeared regularly in clubs
              throughout California. They appeared twice on television as contestants on The Gong
              Show: winning with the lowest score ever (8) on their first appearance and gonged off
              during their second appearance. The Tribe was never influenced by, or had anything to
              do with, slam poetics. Slam is a competition and competitive poetry was not a part of
              The Lost Tribe's work.</p>

            <p>Sholom "Red" Stodolsky founded and operated Baroque Bookstore aka The University of
              Red from 1972 until his death in 1998 at the age of 82. Griffin created the plaque in
              tribute to Red, a major bookman in Hollywood and Los Angeles. According to Griffin,
              among others, Red's shop was influential and essential for hardcore Bukowski fans,

            <p>John Fish (1946-2003) was part of the Venice West/Temple of Man group. Fish created
              many art works and covers for Black Ace, Croupier Press, Bowery, and Temple of Man
              publications (all Venice West/Temple of Man collectives). Fish created the
              illustrations for Stuart Z. Perkoff's <title render="italic">Eat The Earth</title>
              (Black Ace/Bowery, 1971), the cover for Stuart Z. Perkoff's <title render="italic"
                >Kowboy Pomes</title> (Croupier Press, 1973), and the cover for Tony Scibella's
                <title render="italic">Big Trees</title> (Black Ace/Bowery, 1973). Fish's art may
              also be found in many of the Venice West/Temple of Man chapbooks and broadsides.</p>

            <p>Box 241: The following is Griffin's stream of consciousness description of some of
              the elements found within this piece: "Tony was born/died in October (riding horse
              #10). He was also an avid track guy/gambler. Black Ace represents Venice West/Temple
              of Man/The Lady/process. Idealized nude female/The Lady ... and Tony loved the women,
              so this image was really just for him. The couple getting married is a photo of
              Lorraine and I from our wedding which Tony officiated. One of Stuart Z. Perkoff's most
              well known poems, "Coop" was written for Gary Cooper as he was dying from cancer, a
              friend of Stuart's. George Washington, the father of our country is smoking weed, Tony
              smoked weed. Andy Warhol is peering thru along with a soup can above representing the
              Ferus Gallery/Wallace Berman. Tony was a veteran of the Korean War where he lost
              hearing in one ear working the cannons. Crowds of people from history on the left.

            <p>Box 250: Griffin created this Presidential Campaign Sticker Head in 2005 out of
              leftover bumper stickers that he designed and printed in support of the Kerry-Edwards
              campaign of 2004. Griffin fashioned this sticker art birthday present for former Lost
              Tribe member and Carma Bum, Mike M. Mollett to resemble a "mud head" donned by members
              of a wandering tribe Mollett founded in 1988 called The Mudmen. Later they changed
              their name to The L.A. Mudmen and today they exist as The L.A. Mudpeople.</p>
            <p>Box 252: Griffin created the Territory of Pointillist Mongrels poster using Mark
              Hartenbach's art for a show he produced and curated for Hartenbach at Beyond Baroque.
              According to Griffin, he "Jackson Pollacked" the Mike Kelly Art Gallery at Beyond
              Baroque with Richard Modiano and Danny Baker in preparation for this event.</p>

            <p>Harry Hasekian (1954-2009) was a regular at the Hothouse Coffeehouse in the Valley
              and at the Onyx Cafe. A friend of Griffin, S.A. bought this piece from him with some
              of his early Screen Actors Guild (SAG) retirement money. At the time of purchase,
              Hasekian was living at his father's house, which was being sold or possibly foreclosed
              upon. Hasekian was depressed at the time because he was on the verge of homelessness.
              Griffin found out years later that Hasekian committed suicide within a few months of
              selling him this piece.</p>

            <p>Griffin's mail art logo started out as an "X" with "SA/DA/DA/DA" since he lifted it
              from Kurt Schwitters' <title render="italic">Merz</title> magazine and his "X" with
              "DA/DA/DA/DA" when Griffin was deeply involved in the mail art community during the
              early 1990s. Griffin's logo morphed into "SA/LA/DA/DA" by the mid to late 1990s, and
              ultimately into "SA/LA/LA/LA." The present incarnation of the logo is on one of the
              fins of the Poetry Bomb as a tribute to Dada and its influence on whatever it is
              Griffin thinks he is doing. Additionally, this "SA/LA/LA/LA" logo was used by UCLA
              Library Special Collections as the bookplate graphic for Griffin's collection of
              monographs, chapbooks, and broadsides.</p>

              his life in Los Angeles. The 1994 Northridge earthquake activated McCullough's Post
              Traumatic Stress Disorder during which, he went on a binger and was found dead
              February 24, 1994. During McCullough's life, Griffin published some of his poems in
                <title render="italic">(Sic) Vice &amp; Verse</title> broadsides and after his death

              positioned Disney characters Mickey and Minnie Mouse in various sexual positions

            <p>Poet and artist Tony Scibella (1932-2003) along with poet/artists Stuart Z. Perkoff
              and Frank T. Rios were the three poet/progenitors who helped establish the Venice West
              scene. Scibella helped Perkoff open the Venice West Cafe painting the word "expresso"
              on the front glass instead of "espresso." Scibella was a close friend and mentor to
              Griffin. On September 9, 2000, Scibella officiated Griffin's wedding to Lorraine
              Perrotta next to the Griffith Park merry-go-round. A bookman of the old school,
              Scibella helped establish Ogden Bookstore and Kugleman &amp; Bent Books in Denver and
              Black Ace Books in Los Angeles. Scibella published and edited the first editions of
              the Black Ace anthologies.</p>
            <p>Box 248: This piece was a gift to Griffin from Ray Hoffman (Majestic Litho) who
              printed Black Ace 8. Hoffman printed many editions of Black Ace an was an old friend
              of Scibella's. Griffin published Black Ace 8 with Marsha Getzler and John Macker.</p>
            <p>Box 258: This collage was a gift from Tony in 1998 after Griffin completed work on
                <title render="italic">The Outlaw Bible of American Poetry</title>. This piece is
              part of a series of collages that Scibella created using nudes from skin magazines. He
              had a show for the finished work downtown at the Victor Clothing Building, the
              historic site of Kent Twitchell's <title render="italic">The Bride and Groom</title>
              mural. </p>
            <p>Box 265: This piece was a gift to musician Fred Katz, a jazz musician/composer who
              wrote the soundtrack for <title render="italic">Bucket of Blood</title>. Griffin won
              this on eBay and drove to Orange County to pick it up late one night toward the end of
              Katz's life when he was divesting himself of property. There is a Venice trolley token
              embedded in the piece.</p>

            <p>This was a gift from Griffin's friend Lon Spiegelman (1941-2002). He was an American
              mail artist, fluxist, and networker known for his view of mail art as a non-commercial
              art unable to be bought or sold. Involved in mail art since the late 1970s, Spiegelman
              was the editor and publisher of <title render="italic">Spiegelman's Mail Art

              He was a major figure and mentored many. Wilson was making art and writing in his
              journals daily almost up until the moment he passed.</p>

          <p>Scott Wannberg (February 20, 1953 – August 19, 2011) was a poet, performer, and
            bookseller. Wannberg studied creative writing at San Francisco State University and
            received his Master's in 1977. From 1989 to 2009 he performed and toured with The Carma
            Bums. Wannberg, who had a deep knowledge of film history, used longhand to create
            extensive lists of films and actors, and acted in several movies. For 23 years, Wannberg
            worked at Dutton's Bookstore in Brentwood, where he had a local following. In 2008, when
            Dutton's closed, Wannberg moved to Oregon. Beyond Baroque honored the life and work of
            Wannberg through the dedication of its bookstore as the Scott Wannberg Memorial
            Bookstore and Poetry Lounge in February 2012.</p>
