    <head>Biography/History</head>
<p>S.A. Griffin (Steven Allan Griffin), born March 16, 1954, is a poet, performance artist, publisher, and actor. After graduating from high school in 1972, Griffin voluntarily entered the United States Air Force as an administration specialist and was honorably discharged in 1976. In 1978, Griffin relocated to Los Angeles from San Francisco with a scholarship to attend the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera Workshop. Griffin's awards for his work on stage and on camera include a Dramalogue Award and a Kari Award.</p><p>In 1982, Griffin became involved with poetry when he began attending open poetry readings at the Water Espresso Gallery in Hollywood. During this time he became active in the punk scene as a poet and performance artist, appearing at various Southern California venues such as The Lhasa Club, Anti-Club, X=Art, Al's Bar, Safari Sam's and Club Lingerie. In the mid-1980s, Griffin became directly involved in DIY publishing as a staff member of <title render="italic">Shattersheet</title>, and in 1988 he established Rose of Sharon Press with the publication of <title render="italic">Sharktalk</title> by Doug Knott. In 1989 Griffin was named Best Performance Poet by Wanda Coleman in the <title render="italic">LA Weekly</title>.</p><p>In addition to a deep level of involvement in the community through writing, publishing, performing, and hosting poetry events, Griffin extensively collected the publications, artwork, and related ephemera of Los Angeles poets. These materials relate to Venice West, the Los Angeles Beat poetry scene named after the café owned and operated by Stuart Z. Perkoff from 1958-1962, and the Denver, Colorado Beat scene to where many Venice West Beats migrated. He also collected materials related to influential poets such as d.a. levy, Kurt Schwitters, Jack Micheline, Tony Scibella, and Charles Bukowski. With Alan Kaufman, Griffin edited <title render="italic">The Outlaw Bible of American Poetry</title> (1999).</p><p>In 1985, Griffin and fellow poets Michael Lane Bruner, Doug Knott, and Mike M. Mollett formed The Lost Tribe. From 1985-1988 and in 1992, the group performed poetry in choreographed routines both locally and on tour. In 1989, the group underwent a philosophical shift and transformed, joined by Scott Wannberg (and occasionally Bobbo Staron and Ellyn Maybe), into The Carma Bums, a traveling improvisational performance group. The Carma Bums performed until 2009. From 1995-1996, Griffin and punk musician-poets Iris Berry and Pleasant Gehman formed White Trash Apocalypse, in Gehman's words, "a spoken word tour…treated…like a rock'n'roll tour," which toured the United States and Canada. In 2010, Griffin went on tour with The Poetry Bomb, a decommissioned bomb purchased by Griffin and filled with poetry at readings throughout the country, intending to "foster disagreements…the cornerstone of our democratic system." Since 2007 Griffin has performed with the punk-jazz improvisational group The Lofty Canaanites, composed primarily of members of Saccharine Trust.</p><p>Griffin studied film acting and cold reading with Jeremiah Comey and performance technique with Scot Kelman. From 2005 to 2013, Griffin taught film acting and cold reading at the American Film Institute, and since 2012, Griffin has taught film acting and cold reading for Jeremiah Comey. Since 2010, Griffin has served on the curatorial board for Beyond Baroque, and in 2011 Griffin was the first recipient of Beyond Baroque's Distinguished Service Award.</p><p>Griffin continues to live and work in Los Angeles. He is married to Lorraine Perrotta, a librarian and veteran member of The L.A. Mudpeople. Griffin has a son, Spencer, from a previous marriage to Sharon Grish.</p>  </bioghist>

Zabrecky was a member of Possum Dixon, a magician and an actor. Griffin met Rob through Pleasant Gehman when they did a gig at the Pik Me Up Cafe around 1992. Griffin tailors the ceremonies to suit the couple even these vows have not fundamentally changed since he performed his first wedding in 1995 for Eric Brown and Tori Williams.

Jim walked into Al's one night giving away free issues to introduce the zine to everyone. Mike Bruner and Griffin responded immediately and volunteered to do whatever Jim wanted. <title render="italic">Shattersheet</title> was important because not only did it publish poetry, but it was the first publication, to Griffin's knowledge, that published a fairly comprehensive listing of poetry events in and around Southern California. Just previous to this Griffin had worked at Medicus, a local printing broker. With Jim and April, wanting to learn everything he could about DIY/small press, Griffin did much of the same tasks: cut and paste, inputting on the ancient Mac used primarily for word processing, collating/folding, distribution, collections, and some editing. Working with <title render="italic">Shattersheet</title> Griffin got to know the local community and became very familiar with Scott Wannberg's work long before they met and became friends. Wannberg's book <title render="italic">The Electric Yes Indeed!</title>, officially published by Shelf Life Press and with initial editing and publishing by Jim, became the second book Griffin had published.</p><p>As <title render="italic">Shattersheet</title> was waning, <title render="italic">The Moment</title> was on its way up, in Griffin's opinion inspired by the local success of <title render="italic">Shattersheet</title>. <title render="italic">The Moment</title> was edited and published by Kevin Bartnof, Chris Behling and Eric Lyden, who were more Gonzo in their approach. With <title render="italic">The Moment</title>, Griffin was introduced to a deeper Beat dynamic, and in time was introduced to Allen Ginsberg and Jack Micheline, among others. In Griffin's words, "the Carma Bums got directly plugged into <title render="italic">The Moment</title> since we fit directly into what it was they were all about."</p><p>Griffin became friends with Rafael FJ Alvarado, a regular of the old Onyx, when he disrupted a reading that Griffin was conducting at The Onyx Cafe on Vermont. Eventually, Alvarado and Griffin would publish and edit <title render="italic">(Sic) Vice &amp; Verse</title>, first as the broadside <title render="italic">(Sic) Random Vice &amp; Verse</title>, then as a periodical. Griffin worked directly with Michael Simmons and Rachel Kusher.</p></bioghist><phystech id="aspace_66f5b74b9271306d6cc136bac7a8edb6"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>SUBSERIES CONTAINS AUDIOVISUAL MATERIALS: Special equipment or further processing may be

Bruner, Griffin, Doug Knott, and Mike M. Mollett created The Lost Tribe. Later, with Bobbo Staron and Scott Wannberg, they reformed as The Carma Bums. Still working together, most recently as The Lost Bums (Bruner, Griffin, Knott, and Mollett) they created a CD of readings and spontaneous raps produced by Bruner <title render="italic">The Lost Bums: Ozark Revelations</title> (2016) and forthcoming <title render="italic">The Hideous Bible</title> (Rose of Sharon). Griffin published and edited Bruner's book <title render="italic">Natural Geographics</title> (Rose of Sharon) in 2014. Bruner is now the head of admissions at Georgia State University. While working towards his double Masters at the University of Washington, Seattle in 1994, Bruner would bring The Carma Bums into the new frontier of the Internet via the tech department at the university resulting in The Carma Bums International Superhighway Tour of Words, considered the first poetry website of its kind featuring original writing, graphic images, and hyperlinks.</p></bioghist></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref2172_azp" level="file"><did><unittitle>Caldera, Leslie</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1993</unitdate><container id="aspace_2df6c754f5533a0363585232d6924b04" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">154</container><container id="aspace_c90ceee4c5127bc370f9be29a398d31f" parent="aspace_2df6c754f5533a0363585232d6924b04" type="folder">21</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref2173_m0h" level="file"><did><unittitle>Campbell, Pris</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_251965a7f5c46e4e873411211bd967ea" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">154</container><container id="aspace_69c5855cf4376c19d8de23e2be3e1a1e" parent="aspace_251965a7f5c46e4e873411211bd967ea" type="folder">22</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref2174_v5x" level="file"><did><unittitle>Castro, Fernando D.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1993</unitdate><container id="aspace_bc7691553e10d34aeac80d314f982fe0" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">154</container><container id="aspace_f4f89e2afcf3abcf65fbccd22d85fb5d" parent="aspace_bc7691553e10d34aeac80d314f982fe0" type="folder">23</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref2176_nku" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cherkovski, Neeli</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1988</unitdate><container id="aspace_0acfdc5ff121810c26ad10a4d688cb16" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">154</container><container id="aspace_37475127e56e48165a348c194f9c18c0" parent="aspace_0acfdc5ff121810c26ad10a4d688cb16" type="folder">24</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_719de6146999281a5a4979e799d90277"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This folder contains a copy of "Charles Bukowski Notes On A Dirty Old Man" with Cherkovski's annotations and edits.

Spencer was born in Santa Monica, California on December 29, 1987 and diagnosed as autistic by Dr. BJ Freeman (UCLA) in 1990. Griffin's brother and sister Robin and Robert were diagnosed as "mentally retarded" when they were about 1-2 years old, and it was later suggested that they were more than likely misdiagnosed at the time, both of them quite possibly on the autism spectrum. When Dr. Freeman explained to the Griffins why she considered Spencer to be autistic, Griffin believed he too must be autistic. Sharon and S.A. have since concluded that Spencer has Asperger's. Griffin is deeply proud of his son, who graduated from Village Glen High School in Sherman Oaks, attended Glendale Community College and Pasadena City College, and received his AA from American River College. Spencer received his BA from UC Davis in 2015 with a major in linguistics. He plays guitar and writes music and poetry. Griffin published <title render="italic">When Is The Future?</title> (Rose of Sharon, 1997) for him when he was ten years old.</p></bioghist></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref2469_ofj" level="file"><did><unittitle>Herms, George</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1965</unitdate><container id="aspace_59e267081958876b1f43cf5cfa4cc550" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">164</container><container id="aspace_f63393a3cf8641641dcdb9bf3fd65694" parent="aspace_59e267081958876b1f43cf5cfa4cc550" type="folder">1</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_2d6f4a8108b8a0a20efd72bc0000249a"><head>Scope and Content</head><p>A <title render="italic">Spring Visions</title> exhibition Stryke Gallery flyer and color copies of collages.</p></scopecontent><bioghist id="aspace_c97cd90ccf78c2c9a9ddd68f51989fd4"><head>Biography/History</head><p>George Herms was an assemblage artist, performance artist, and poet.</p></bioghist></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref2470_33l" level="file"><did><unittitle>H.I.P.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">2009</unitdate><container id="aspace_b8bee64abfe7eef142d1d232fbc7daff" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">164</container><container id="aspace_48c26e080ed0bf1e09dc99bd24546da4" parent="aspace_b8bee64abfe7eef142d1d232fbc7daff" type="folder">2</container></did><processinfo id="aspace_65f81cd01be9e22eeb315935fbb57925"><head>Processing Information</head><p>City of Los Angeles certificates for H.I.P. may be found in Box 168, Folder 14.</p></processinfo><scopecontent id="aspace_5ef9f930d43be497e22a618e6f8e5e9f"><head>Scope and Content</head><p>A Hollywood Institute of Poetics (H.I.P.) events calendar.</p></scopecontent><bioghist id="aspace_df32f74baea9895f4b8e7ce5b190230a"><head>Biography/History</head><p>The Hollywood Institute of Poetics was created by S.A.

The rabbit is Kryss's signature image, a symbol of "rabbits everywhere" reflecting levy's ethic to "cover the city (of Cleveland) with lines (of poetry)" in service of this cultural revolution.</p></bioghist></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref2486_749" level="file"><did><unittitle>The Lhasa Club</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1987</unitdate><container id="aspace_70889a4e7b1e16c900ceb1d35549f1ef" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">164</container><container id="aspace_a90fa5d61a2ff076727a428f67ce8669" parent="aspace_70889a4e7b1e16c900ceb1d35549f1ef" type="folder">25</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_0e2af47b6da7622ad8491c72fd0e26d5"><head>Scope and Content</head><p>An article on the closure of the Lhasa Club</p></scopecontent><bioghist id="aspace_a4e2ea005dede9251f6cf0a8b02d449e"><head>Biography/History</head><p>The Lhasa Club (1982-1988) was a Hollywood punk / performance venue owned and operated by Jean-Pierre Boccara and his partner Anna Mariani.

In 1961 Baldwin-Moore relocated to Seattle with Morris, where she gave birth to their daughter Danette (Leos) Costello. According to Baldwin-Moore, Morris began public drug debates with Timothy Leary in Seattle. The debates ultimately took Morris to Denver around 1965 where he met Diana, whom he married.

The Onyx was owned and operated by John Leech who first opened it with his partner, Fumiko Robinson. Griffin curated a number of poetry series at the Onyx Sequel including Angina and Slow Train and debuted his video/performance <title render="italic">Act of Kindness</title> there. Griffin produced and staged Open Ended It performances, which included Jack Kerouac's Birthday Party, at the Echo. Beck was an Onyx regular and used to open for some of the poetry shows. Owner John Leech said that his goal with the Onyx was to create a venue to promote art and artists, as well as create a meeting space. The following were some of the artist regulars: Gronk, Anthony Ausgang, Van Arno, Louis Metz, Barry Markowitz, Stacey Lande, Andy Takakjian, Steve LaPonsie, Manuel A Campo and Lucas Reiner. Additionally, poet Steve Abee, musician Michael Whitmore, performance artist Mo Figuls, and artist Stacy Lande were a few who worked there over the years. Michael Whitmore and Michael Carpenter assisted Leech with the cafe's daily operations. Leech was a friend and surrogate father to many who called the Onyx home. At Thanksgiving and Christmas, Leech would close the doors and open to the regulars, providing a free feast for all. There were also many backyard BBQs behind The Onyx on Vermont. The Onyx closed in 1998. Griffin attempted to produce an Onyx reunion a number of times, but Leech refused to allow it. Finally, in 2008, Leech agreed to allow Griffin to produce a ten-year anniversary gathering on October 11, 2008 at the Tribal Cafe in Echo Park, owned and operated by Joshua Jose, a former regular at The Onyx. When Leech passed away in March 2009, his memorial was held at the Tribal Cafe.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_93a6938afd4c28d96f23e681b402d7ca"><head>Scope and Content</head><p>Flyers, photographs, posters, articles, postcards, John Leech memorial programs, Mark Edward Gash memorial folder, artwork, some onyx names/events list, and poetry.</p></scopecontent></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref2498_isn" level="file"><did><unittitle>Outlaw Bible</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1997-1999</unitdate><container id="aspace_0bb795c2359c7c36f4d4fae11fcf1eab" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">166</container><container id="aspace_5601cd111c25a4f34b33d24734107281" parent="aspace_0bb795c2359c7c36f4d4fae11fcf1eab" type="folder">1</container></did><phystech id="aspace_83e657e4444f1327a0c0c5e647e1a8b2"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Three 3.5 inch floppy disks.</p><p>Special equipment or further processing may be required for viewing.

When Micheline passed away, Griffin eulogized him in his Onword column for <title render="italic">Damaged Goods</title>, a Los Angeles based underground / small press lit-poetry serial edited and published by Tracy Lee Williams. The piece was picked up and published online at BookZen.com, where another friend of Micheline's, Alan Kaufman, read it and then began an email correspondence with Griffin. During the course of their correspondence Griffin said that he had always wanted to create an "anthology of California poets like Jack who never got their due in life." Alan responded, "Me too," and they were on. Kaufman had a connection with a literary agent who pitched the project which was then picked up by Neil Ortenberg at Thunders Mouth Press in New York. Ortenberg's only caveat was that the project had to be an anthology covering the national scene with six weeks to create it from start to finish. The book ended up taking over a year to execute online via email and telephone with Griffin in Los Angeles, Kaufman in San Francisco, and Ortenberg in New York.</p></bioghist></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref2499_x9j" level="file"><did><unittitle>Out Loud</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1992-1993</unitdate><container id="aspace_1a3c8badc1140340345052218c810c23" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">166</container><container id="aspace_4e840bca9b3eb4ac856466cd50819879" parent="aspace_1a3c8badc1140340345052218c810c23" type="folder">2</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_354125d46fe0991df03e591b6ff704c3"><head>Scope and Content</head><p>Three copies of this free monthly Los Angeles poetry calendar and an Out Loud Town Meeting Agenda with the objective to reach a consensus on the appropriate community response to the discontinuance of the calendar.</p></scopecontent><bioghist id="aspace_3d085979aeb97653f3eebdfb5bdf8fb8"><head>Biography/History</head><p>A poetry newsletter published and edited by Carrie Etter with listings covering poetry venues and events in Southern California.</p></bioghist></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref2500_sii" level="file"><did><unittitle>Perkoff, Stuart Z.</unittitle><container id="aspace_1309747ec49a604db22a05ca78cefe31" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">166</container><container id="aspace_41681db4e0fcc6c573e167827615eeab" parent="aspace_1309747ec49a604db22a05ca78cefe31" type="folder">3</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1cfc764e998deb95defc09b8b1909710"><head>Scope and Content</head><p>Cover for How It Is, Doing What I Do, photograph of James Ryan Morris and Tony Scibella, "we carry our crises within our heads" Croupier Press Poetry Card Series #6, Only Just Above The Ground dedication card to Tony Scibella, Frank Rice, and James Ryan Morris, clipping with photograph of an 18-year-old Perkoff leaving Manhattan Selective Service headquarters with deputy marshals, and Tony Scibella's invitation from Frank T.

Kelman wrote, directed and produced performance and theatre, and also taught performance there. Kelman taught and directed John Fleck, Kedric Robin Wolfe, The Lost Tribe, and Deborah Oliver.

Venice West was created by Abbott Kinney in the late 19th century to become a "beach community that would foster a cultural renaissance...on the shores of the Pacific," which he modeled after Venice, Italy. The Temple of Man is a non-profit started by Robert "Baza" or "Bob" Alexander (1923-1987) in San Francisco, California in 1960 as a center for "poetry, jazz and art." The Temple of Man moved to Venice, California in 1968 and still thrives in Los Angeles with a national membership. Poet and writer Ed Ward of Denver wrote a piece detailing the genesis of the Temple of Man wherein he recalls Stuart Z. Perkoff's incarceration, "a friend of Stuart's, the artist/poet/printer Robert Alexander, visited the prison [the Penitentiary at Terminal Island] but was told that visitors - other than family (father, son, brother, wife, etc) or chaplains - were not allowed. And so for this very pragmatic reason - among other less pragmatic reasons such as his interest in art, poetry, community and ritual - Baza founded The Temple of Man in 1960, a non-profit religious organization. To visit an incarcerated friend."</p></bioghist></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref2526_s8w" level="file"><did><unittitle>Wannberg, Scott</unittitle><container id="aspace_fe5548d896a5c0eab413f9069b0380c9" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">167</container><container id="aspace_c09e443a0c07590519b040d3c0d957ef" parent="aspace_fe5548d896a5c0eab413f9069b0380c9" type="folder">12</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1f7ed97743cc9712084cb68bdfca60f3"><head>Scope and Content</head><p>A flyer for Wannberg's Juice!

He cited Walt Whitman, Charles Bukowski, and William Carlos Williams as major poetic influences. He also mentored many younger poets and writers. His interests in music, history, and cinema were accompanied with encyclopedic knowledge of them. He would often write poems for visiting authors on reading tours coming through Dutton's and created correspondences with many writers including historian Page Smith, with whom he was close. His mentors at San Francisco State were Stan Rice and Daniel J. Langton.</p><p>Griffin and Wannberg began their close friendship sometime in 1987.

Hudson Avenue with its entrance on Santa Monica Boulevard. This was the first place where Griffin read poetry in public outside of an academic setting. Responding to an ad in Dramalogue, Griffin began attending the Wednesday night open readings at The Water sometime in 1981. The Water was across the street from the Kit Kat Klub, a strip club that during the punk era doubled as a performance venue for acts like The Red Hot Chili Peppers. The Water was part of a complex in the arts building owned by Sauls that also housed The Lhasa Club and The Figtree Theatre. At the time, there were very few places to read poetry for those involved in what could be called the alternative or underground poetry scene, which is why these poets often opened for bands, or read between bands as they set up. Griffin met the future members of The Lost Tribe and Bobbo Staron at the Water. Other Wednesday night open reader/performers included Leah Really, Linda Sibio, Alan Pulner, Jimmy Townes, Johnny Forever, Janet Klein, Steve Wolfe, Salmon Murphy, and Ben Downing. The Wednesday night open was originally hosted by a soft-spoken man named Benjamin who didn't last long after attendance began to increase. The hosting duties were picked up by Ben Downing, a gentle giant of a man who had come to Los Angeles to be an actor. Tired of struggling to make ends meet as an actor, Downing returned to his home in Arkansas where he worked as a journalist. Griffin continued to correspond with Downing until he received a letter from Ben's mother in which she shared that Ben had been struck and killed by a car as they were walking down the road together. After Downing, the evenings were hosted by Leah Really and then Doug Knott. About this time, Knott began producing and hosting a long running series of punk variety shows at The Lhasa Club called "Doug Knott Presents."</p></bioghist></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref2528_cqq" level="file"><did><unittitle>White, Saul</unittitle><container id="aspace_5f6715cc7fa8656bc042cc906c524d51" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">167</container><container id="aspace_37a9c2185eaf3c1937ac8ccb2a235046" parent="aspace_5f6715cc7fa8656bc042cc906c524d51" type="folder">14</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_2a458dd50f35317bf929e1e3dd9ad34d"><head>Scope and Content</head><p>Exhibition cards, correspondence to Marsha Getzler concerning White's memorial, copies of White's poems and a clipping on The Temple of Man's Reverend Bob Alexander.</p></scopecontent><bioghist id="aspace_39015aaa4d73dfb56682aba7f5e7bde3"><head>Biography/History</head><p>Saul White (1932-2003) was a Venice West abstract expressionist and jazz poet. Born in New York, White moved to Los Angeles in 1945 and attended Fairfax High where he befriended Wallace Berman who was considered by many to be an artistic and spiritual center of the Venice West scene. After serving during the Korean War, White attended Otis Art Institute on a fellowship. In the mid 1950s he rented a storefront in Venice on Ocean Avenue that became a gathering place for artists including Edward Kienholz and John Altoon. In 1957 White was part of a series of readings with Kenneth Patchen and Kenneth Rexroth at the Los Angeles Jazz Concert Hall, accompanied by Shorty Rogers' jazz band. White relocated to New York in 1958 where he became a fixture in the Greenwich Village art scene. There he met and became friends with Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline. In the early 1960s White was invited to live and work with de Kooning in East Hampton where he helped build de Kooning's studio. In time he returned to Los Angeles. Producing work to the end, Saul had a studio in San Pedro where he left behind a legacy of work. His son Aaron White, by his former wife and artist Michele White, is an artist living in Denver.</p></bioghist></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref2529_gqh" level="file"><did><unittitle>White Trash Apocalypse</unittitle><container id="aspace_e148f902bf9fa06293c23bfc0ceab4c9" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">167</container><container id="aspace_19df8e0072ab0f623e9e94ff1c0ab6d0" parent="aspace_e148f902bf9fa06293c23bfc0ceab4c9" type="folder">15</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_7f175b3a6cb84280cbf15f42b29a1ff8"><head>Scope and Content</head><p>Performance flyers, tour itinerary, photographs and clippings.</p></scopecontent><bioghist id="aspace_24f1b662a459a7e88a0bad1cd27900f8"><head>Biography/History</head><p>Iris Berry (Bikini Atoll Berry Gabor), Pleasant Gehman (Gamma Ray Gehman Gabor) and S.A. Griffin (Sunny Meltdown Riviera) came together in October 1995 to create performance poetry ensemble White Trash Apocalypse (WTA). According to Griffin, Berry and Gehman wanted to go on the road and decided that he should be the third wheel and the driver. The group name was derived from a poem of the same name by Gehman. Berry and Gehman donned their rhinestone tiaras and faux leopard coats while Griffin wore vintage polyester and bright colored Hush Puppies. Joining them on their 1995 tour as their official photographer was Gehman's boyfriend at the time Jeffoto (Snaps Reactor), who had relocated from Boston to be a part of the Carma Bums' 1991 Nowhere Tour of Words and never left. S.A. Griffin drove his burgundy 1971 Buick Riviera for the White Trash Apocalypse Words On Wheels 1995 Tour of Words. WTA jokingly referred to themselves as "The Veets," a pun marrying Velveeta cheese and The Beats to reflect their goal as poets and performers to reach the "highest cheese possible." WTA opened for The Geraldine Fibbers at the Hotel Congress in Tucson, Arizona. Partying in the hotel after the gig, they were given their mission by one of the Fibbers to find the "Hope Rhinestone" which they stumbled upon at the Liberace Museum in Las Vegas, Nevada. The trio continued to perform together and tour as White Trash Apocalypse throughout 1995-1996.</p></bioghist></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref2530_pal" level="file"><did><unittitle>Wilson, Steve</unittitle><container id="aspace_5d21da8dc55187b4aab5ada6052d320b" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">167</container><container id="aspace_371e3ddebbc75c6073ae759bb268ccb8" parent="aspace_5d21da8dc55187b4aab5ada6052d320b" type="folder">16</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e985c4c480b411976e1d68d3b9f4a3ec"><head>Scope and Content</head><p>Exhibition flyers, mailers, catalogue, Mile High and Underground post cards, clippings a biography of Wilson.</p></scopecontent><bioghist id="aspace_99522d09232d0e0f87593cd8a853544d"><head>Biography/History</head><p>Venice West artist, poet and bookman, Steve Wilson was born in Long Beach but spent the majority of his life living and working in and around Denver, Colorado where he passed away in 2012.

BeBop Records was located across the street from The Country Club in Reseda. According to Griffin, during its operation (1982-1990), BeBop was one of the premiere punk, poetry and performance venues in the Los Angeles area. The first band to play there was Los Lobos. In August 1989 The Carma Bums performed there for the first time anywhere. After the show, The Bums loaded up the '59 Cadillac outside the front door of BeBop, baptized it with a bottle of Coca-Cola across the bow and then hit the road for their Carma Bums 1989 No Seat Belts Tour of Words to Denver, Colorado where the idea for the Bums was born.</p></bioghist></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref2586_16a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bella Lewitzky Dance Company program</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1978 January 13</unitdate><container id="aspace_77d4fa1dac949fab2f9e301fc5e14d42" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">179</container><container id="aspace_01ec21bd273fac68c2352999f2717545" parent="aspace_77d4fa1dac949fab2f9e301fc5e14d42" type="folder">9</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_3b7bb8249361c119af694914181eea6c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This Chabot College program is signed by Lewitzky.</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref2578_kdh" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bomb script</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">2001 February 25</unitdate><container id="aspace_38e03f6d8cec6dcfdbeebaeb33086ee8" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">179</container><container id="aspace_d79a434af945c4da02d7e900fba6618c" parent="aspace_38e03f6d8cec6dcfdbeebaeb33086ee8" type="folder">10</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d7aba1d1d345fe4ef58e51e8ecb87dfd"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This folder contains the script for "Man As Bomb: Gregory Corso Celebrated," Griffin's adaptation of Gregory Corso's "Bomb" which he arranged and directed for theatrical presentation at Corso's Skylight Books memorial.</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref2588_19b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Book Bound flyer</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">circa 2001</unitdate><container id="aspace_fc9a78c41d50866657123c38955441ba" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">179</container><container id="aspace_c89fb04dcafad4a82d925e11fd69e11d" parent="aspace_fc9a78c41d50866657123c38955441ba" type="folder">11</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c43c10f54e6c00255dcc861fa3027f1d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This flyer announces an evening in Echo Park to celebrate the release of <title render="italic">Unborn Again</title> with Griffin, Ellyn Maybe, and Scott Wannberg.</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref2590_nmh" level="file"><did><unittitle>BOSS Video EZTV</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1985</unitdate><container id="aspace_f2c5a78540f897b57d9f95a6f8e8598f" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">179</container><container id="aspace_b98035608ffb0e42ba6be7087f0b5862" parent="aspace_f2c5a78540f897b57d9f95a6f8e8598f" type="folder">12-13</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_2a391559ef4079672115195cc9d04202"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Materials include flyers, press releases, scripts, performance schedules, and mailing lists for Griffin's BOSS performance space at EZTV, 8547 Santa Monica Boulevard.</p></scopecontent></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref2592_uwn" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bukowski - Tamarind Theatre</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1996 July</unitdate><container id="aspace_9178eb5ad2039b4dc1d6be319d75d71d" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">179</container><container id="aspace_b4b6d2717077a2ba28e3cb4d891be178" parent="aspace_9178eb5ad2039b4dc1d6be319d75d71d" type="folder">14</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_dbda176737c9101fefbfd8215f4e9301"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Materials include a press kit for the production of Bukowski's "Decline &amp;

Griffin, Doug Knott, and Mike M. Mollett. The formation of the group emerged out of the Wednesday night open readings at The Water Espresso Gallery, as a response to the punk expression and performance happening at the time. A well-rehearsed, crack performance ensemble complete with costumes, props, and only one rule: no work performed was written for performance. The Tribe only choreographed and performed work written as poetry for the page. The Tribe's stated goal was to elevate poetry to something more accessible as entertainment. The Lost Tribe appeared regularly in clubs throughout California. They appeared twice on television as contestants on The Gong Show: winning with the lowest score ever (8) on their first appearance and gonged off during their second appearance. The Tribe was never influenced by, or had anything to do with, slam poetics. Slam is a competition and competitive poetry was not a part of The Lost Tribe's work.</p></bioghist></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref2655_dl9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Mad Daddy's press kit</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">circa 1990s</unitdate><container id="aspace_661fdef86769708a4ed5c807ffa95690" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">188</container><container id="aspace_415734ff4b2c6d70cdc6e4e5c5bea25e" parent="aspace_661fdef86769708a4ed5c807ffa95690" type="folder">25</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1247c4537ae9027881c3ed13f9cb3db5"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This folder contains clippings, signed band photos, a mini-photo album, a ticket stub, small band posters, and a CD entitled Get yer ta tas out!</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_f65a2258bf101046c383716b6a440078"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>One CD.</p><p>Audiovisual materials in this collection will require assessment and possible digitization for safe access.

He was also an avid track guy/gambler. Black Ace represents Venice West/Temple of Man/The Lady/process. Idealized nude female/The Lady ... and Tony loved the women, so this image was really just for him. The couple getting married is a photo of Lorraine and I from our wedding which Tony officiated. One of Stuart Z. Perkoff's most well known poems, "Coop" was written for Gary Cooper as he was dying from cancer, a friend of Stuart's. George Washington, the father of our country is smoking weed, Tony smoked weed. Andy Warhol is peering thru along with a soup can above representing the Ferus Gallery/Wallace Berman. Tony was a veteran of the Korean War where he lost hearing in one ear working the cannons. Crowds of people from history on the left.

Wannberg studied creative writing at San Francisco State University and received his Master's in 1977. From 1989 to 2009 he performed and toured with The Carma Bums. Wannberg, who had a deep knowledge of film history, used longhand to create extensive lists of films and actors, and acted in several movies. For 23 years, Wannberg worked at Dutton's Bookstore in Brentwood, where he had a local following. In 2008, when Dutton's closed, Wannberg moved to Oregon. Beyond Baroque honored the life and work of Wannberg through the dedication of its bookstore as the Scott Wannberg Memorial Bookstore and Poetry Lounge in February 2012.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_690cc70b4702d3a0c9eeda39e2e2a4ab"><head>Scope and Content</head><p>The papers of Scott Wannberg were bequeathed to Griffin and include his manuscript writings and book collection, his correspondence, artwork, and memorabilia.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_ref3131_6wq" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Writings by Wannberg</unittitle><container id="aspace_823670de77b8ac692a27cf0ba461746a" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">293</container><container id="aspace_6e9b004253b7e49f08eefb24004d0ba5" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">294</container><container id="aspace_0eeadddd1821b2830aed9e32832f25d4" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">295</container><container id="aspace_d41446fddc4b4a9547acf80b4c7f9545" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">296</container><container id="aspace_f9e0975149d269f111503ff4c082a427" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">297</container><container id="aspace_707d8f8970fe8fb3455da6a0b6febc78" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">298</container><container id="aspace_ed194337909905a6c8676a7d9a1ab17b" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">299</container><container id="aspace_582f76dcb7f97d08929ee562967c6d4c" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">300</container><container id="aspace_a5fa6982d020b8e970e9bbee738b3874" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">301</container><container id="aspace_613444b1bc39388bbdc06fcdcdc955dd" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">302</container><container id="aspace_3abc30ecd6d1cdead4a08851afab35d0" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">303</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_7c6082364b4ca8230a5d2b0b300633b3"><head>Scope and Content</head><p>Writings by Wannberg include published and unpublished manuscripts, which are organized chronologically; monographs by Wannberg, which are organized chronologically; and serials featuring Wannberg's work, which are organized by title of publication.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref3136_9nw" level="file"><did><unittitle>Manuscripts</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1987-2010</unitdate><container id="aspace_13c356eba1c8b775c7d995d9438debb1" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">293</container><container id="aspace_1005095fef102f241f8fa9c798af1cd5" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">294</container><container id="aspace_bc249f8d9fa7d40340a4d0e7f6489a4f" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">295</container><container id="aspace_6a57c16da6eeabba5cba6a52fbfb1132" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">296</container><container id="aspace_6458f710b24b8b3a94ec1eb450b3e0ac" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">297</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_a74dddc4c8f723cced5bfa13b4cc1404"><head>Scope and Content</head><p>Box 293: Poems include "Scarecrow," "The Ride Out for Love," "Burning Language," and "Bucketful of Yes."
