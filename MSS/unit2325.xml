Local 11 partnered with other labor and community organizations to play a key role in reviving the Los Angeles labor movement during the 1990s and 2000s.  Local 11 grew through mergers with HERE locals in Santa Monica (Local 814) in 2002 and Orange County/Long Beach (Local 681) in 2008. HERE International merged with UNITE (Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees) to form UNITE-HERE in July, 2004. This collection consists of materials documenting UNITE-HERE Locals 11, 814 and 681 and includes files of union leaders Maria Elena Durazo, Kurt Petersen and Tom Walsh, Executive Board meeting minutes, newspaper coverage in English and Spanish of union campaigns, union serial publications, booklets and videos, television coverage of organizing campaigns, transcribed oral histories, photographs and ephemera.</abstract>

    <head>Biography/History</head>
<p>UNITE-HERE Local 11 traces its origins to the Hotel and Restaurant Employees and Bartenders International Union founded in 1891 and has been active in Southern California since the 1930s.  Along with Justice for janitors, LAANE and the County Federation of Labor, it played a key role in reviving the Los Angeles labor movement during the 1990s and 2000s.  HERE International merged with UNITE (Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees Union) to form UNITE-HERE in July, 2004.</p><p>Local 11 has been involved with high profile organizing activities throughout Los Angeles.  In the 1990s they led a multi-year campaign to unionize the New Otani Hotel in Little Tokyo through a card check process as well as campaigns to unionize workers at the Ambassador Hotel and luxury hotels on Santa Monica's beach front.  In 2004 they participated in a national campaign with major hotels across the United States and won important concessions from local hotels.  The local has been a strong proponent of Living Wage and Minimum Wage Ordinances in L.A., Santa Monica and Long Beach and helped create the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy (LAANE).</p><p>Historically waiters, bartenders, waitresses, kitchen and cleaning staff organized into separate locals or chapters. By the 1970s, most locals were geographically based, and included both front of the house staff (e.g., waiters and bartenders) and back of the house staff (e.g. kitchen, cleaning, etc.). During the 1980s and 1990s, the Los Angeles and Santa Monica HERE locals experienced leadership strains, with long serving leaders failing to respond to an increasingly immigrant workforce and anti-union climate;</p><p>Maria Elena Durazo, emerged as a reform leader of Local 11 in the late 1980s, leading several successful organizing drives for HERE, and championing the cause of back of the house staff, mainly Latin American immigrant women. In 1989, Durazo was elected Local 11 president, becoming one of the first Latina leaders of a major American union local. She would eventually serve as Secretary Treasurer of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor (2005 to 2014). In 1995, Local 814 in Santa Monica was placed in trusteeship and in an election the following year, organizer Tom Walsh became president. Kurt Petersen, who joined the United Farm Workers of Washington State as an organizer, started his association with HERE in 1995 and has served the Local and national organization in various capacities.</p><p>The geographic scope of Local 11 grew through mergers with local unions in Santa Monica (Local 814) in 2002, and Orange County/Long Beach (Local 681) in 2008. Tom Walsh became the president of Local 11 after the mergers. The organization, with a membership of over 20,000 in 2018, embraces workers throughout Southern California, with a diverse membership from many immigrant communities as well as African-Americans, Latinos, and Asian-Americans. Industries represented include hotels, casinos, foodservice and retail airport concessions, stadiums and restaurants. Through grassroots mobilization of workers and community allies, Local 11 has improved working conditions, wages, and benefits for their members, transforming traditionally low-wage jobs to middle class jobs, and successfully participates in labor-management partnerships with employers to resolve issues in the workplace.</p>  </bioghist>
