    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>Early portraits of three women by Maull &amp;#x0026; Co. of London, Jabez Hughes of Ryde, Isle of Wight, and A.J. Melhuish of Portman Sq., London, probably dating from 1860s or early 1870s, might include Gerald's mother, Georgiana Susan Pellew (d. 1896), or possibly his grandmother Mary Young (d. 1894). A younger woman, wearing a white hat and holding a basket of flowers might be one of Gerald's sisters--Alice (b. 1849), Ursula (b. 1850), or Mabel (b. 1853). Mabel married Archibald Ernest Orr Ewing of Ballikinrain in Oct. 1879, and their son, Norman Archibald Orr Ewing, born Nov. 23, 1880, is shown at the age of three months, held perhaps by his mother. Later photographs, dating from the late 1870s, might portray Gerald's brothers, Herbert (b. 1859), Harold (b. 1860), and Francis (b. 1861); one of them wears a military uniform, probably of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. Several of the large photographs show interior and exterior shots of Merton College college, highlighting courtyards, Gothic towers, and a croquet lawn. There are also several large photographs of group shots of Gerald's college mates at Oxford, wearing bowler hats or straw boaters, and holding canes, glasses of beer, and a small dog; in one photo, a group of young men sits at a tea table, while a fellow student leans from a window with a teapot to refill their cups. A large sepia-tone photo, laid in, shows a large three-masted sailing/steam vessel (Beagle class steel screw sloops), either the HMS Beagle or HMS Basilisk, in operation between 1889 and 1905. (Cf. Conway's all the world's fighting ships, 1860-1905. New York: Mayflower Books, 1979, p. 59.) Other photographers represented include W.J. Hawker of Bournemouth Hants; Window &amp;#x0026; Grove of London; Binographic Portrait Company of Bournemouth; Courtenay Wynne of Brompton; Aug. Adler, Dresden; J. Hubert Newman of Sydney, N.S.W. [Australia]; and William Cobb of Woolwich, "By Special Appointment to Royal Military Academy."</p>  </scopecontent>
