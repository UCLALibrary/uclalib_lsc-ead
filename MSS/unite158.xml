    <head>History</head>
<p>The United States Building and Loan League was an association formed in 1893 to promote and advocate for state building and loan associations. The Building and Loan League saw the mission of the industry as promoting home ownership through saving and mutual cooperation. Though during financial crises thrift associations were more resilient than banks due to their emphasis on long-term deposits and penalties for withdrawal, the industry still suffered from the Great Depression. In the 1930, the league reorganized with a greater focus on advocacy, particularly in garnering governmental assistance in the form of a federal home loan bank and a federal deposit insurance program. During the same period, regulations were placed on the industry to standardize reporting and regulators who determined interest rates.</p>  </bioghist>
