The women at the meeting discuss the events that took place immediately following the literal lock out and the legal measures that have been taken. They state that the purpose of the meeting is to come to an understanding of where the disagreement stemmed from and what steps to take from that date.</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_10ecb073842822f3d6e4380a86283de9"><head>General note</head><p>Audio quality is poor.</p></odd></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref1249_1xt" level="file"><did><unittitle>Quaker Lesbian Affinity Group: Livermore Action</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1982/1982" type="inclusive">26 June 1982</unitdate><physdesc id="aspace_68d749d04c3b79bf2ef21cb994befcfb" label="General Physical Description note">audio cassette tape</physdesc><container id="aspace_a613d12f5df8168ca0c53acaa6c0c3d2" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_a6c80313558413eedfe02a8625ad9da1" parent="aspace_a613d12f5df8168ca0c53acaa6c0c3d2" type="folder">3</container><container id="aspace_3958962ce127ea8266b236bc571bac5f" parent="aspace_a6c80313558413eedfe02a8625ad9da1" type="item">12</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_05fe13bf4981320732bd4732a926f66c"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Recording of discussion with group of women on the events that took place during Livermore Action, including the process of being arrested by police and the experience of incarceration.
