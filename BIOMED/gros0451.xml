    <head>Administrative/Biographical History</head>
<p>Morton I. Grossman (1919-1981) received an M.D. and a Ph.D. in physiology under Andrew Ivy at Northwestern University, after which he worked at the University of Illinois. During World War II he served at the U.S. Army Medical Nutritional Laboratory. In 1955 he joined the UCLA School of Medicine in physiology and medicine and the Wadsworth Veterans Administration Hospital in West Los Angeles as Chief of Gastroenterology. Grossman promoted a multidisciplinary approach to digestive disorders by creating the Center for Ulcer Research and Education (CURE) in 1974. He was author or co-author of more than 300 papers on gastroenterology and gastrointestinal physiology, and served as Editor (1960-1965) and later chair of the editorial board of "Gastroenterology", the offical publication of the Gastroenterological Association.</p>  </bioghist>
