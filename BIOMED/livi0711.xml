<p>A manuscript record of physician Louis A. Livingood's medical practice in Womelsdorf, Pennsylvania, a borough east of Harrisburg and north of Lancaster, from 1883 through 1894. New entries were added chronologically on 640 [i.e., 641] of 696 pages in a pre-bound, lined ledger. Each page is headed by the name of a head of household; patient visits and reasons are entered chronologically in two columns, along with fees charged. Additional handwritten notes, describing Livingood's obligations to certain patients for other products or services for himself, are pinned to or laid-in alongside the name of the community member.</p>  </scopecontent>
