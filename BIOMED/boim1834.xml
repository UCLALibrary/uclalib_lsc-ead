Materials in the collection span Boime's graduate studies and lengthy career, including seminal research on Vincent Van Gogh, Impressionism and the French Commune, and a 6-volume History of Modern Art written from a social history perspective. Though best known for his work on 18th and 19th century European art, Boime's papers cover a broad range of traditional and avant-garde Art History topics approached from a social history theoretical framework.</abstract>

    <head>Biography/History</head>
<p>Albert Boime was born in St. Louis, Missouri on March 17, 1933 to Max and Dorothy Boime, both eastern European Jewish immigrants. In 1955 Boime joined the U.S. Army, serving in Germany before his discharge in 1958. Upon returning to the States Boime began his studies at the University of California, Los Angeles and received his B.A. in 1961. He went on to receive both his M.A. (1963) and Doctorate (1968) from Columbia University. Through his brother Jerome (1934-1977), Boime met teacher and social activist Myra Block, and they married in 1964.</p><p>He began his career as an instructor at the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1967 and became an associate professor in 1969. He was appointed professor of art at the State University of New York at Binghamton in 1971. Boime chaired the art department at Binghamton from 1972-74 and was recruited by the University of California, Los Angeles in 1978. He served as a professor of art history there for three decades. Boime passed away in 2008.</p><p>As a social art historian Boime was concerned with overlooked artists and ventured outside traditional research methods to evaluate an artist's work. He approached artworks as social documents, not simply artistic expressions, and demonstrated how artists are influenced by the historical events of their lifetime. Though Boime is best known for his studies of 19th-century European art, his work touched on many genres including popular imagery in Europe and America and emblematic national monuments.</p><p>In the course of his career Boime authored nearly 20 books and over 100 articles. He also received various awards including two Guggenheim fellowships (1974, 1984), a Rome Fellowship (1979), and the A. Kingsley Porter Prize for his Art Bulletin article "The Second Republic's Contest for the Figure of the Republic" (1971). In 2006 a symposium on the social history of art was convened at UCLA in his honor.</p><p>Quoting from the preface of his book <title>The Birth of Abstract Romanticism</title>, Boime described his art historical intent, "By examining the political forces that motivated the art makers and finders, and revealing the hidden mainsprings in visual production, I truly believed that I was contributing to the emancipation of thought, at least in one small corner of the minds of my students and readers. Thus art history became my raison d'être, a vehicle for enhancing the lives of my fellow citizens, while at the same time bringing about a nano-change toward social justice in society."</p><p>Sources: Dictionary of Art Historians, <extref xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:show="new" xlink:href="http://www.albertboime.com/">albertboime.com </extref></p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>The collection consists of notes, correspondence, drafts, and annotated photocopies relating to Boime's academic career. Additional materials include VHS tapes, audiocassettes, and 16mm film. The papers include documentation corresponding to universities and Art History departments where he was employed, syllabi and outlines for courses and seminars, notes associated with research, conference materials, drafts of publications, and correspondence. The bulk of the collection consists of materials collected as part of Boime's research activities. Research topics span a wide range, although the bulk of material relates to French history painter Thomas Couture, imagery and symbolism of U.S. monuments and icons, artists and movements associated with his Social History of Modern Art series, social issues, academies and academic painting, the Italian painter group Macchiaioli, and comics and cartoons. Boime often revisited research topics after initially encountering the subject matter, so his files may include materials from different decades on the same research topic. The addition contains similar materials and subjects, and a greater number of audiovisual materials. Box 154 contains film reels that were digitized and documentation from the processing archivist, Chloe Patton.</p>  </scopecontent>

The series covers a variety of subjects, including research conducted during Boime's graduate studies. A constant researcher and student, Boime frequently revisited topics and collected new materials decades after initially embarking on a research endeavor. In addition to his academic interests, Boime's research reveals his sensitivity to contemporary events. Many of his research topics and the materials he collected directly correspond to social, political, and technological changes on campus, locally, nationally, and globally. Though Boime's research materials correspond to a variety of topics ranging from the traditional canon of modern western art to avant-garde contemporary trends, all of his research incorporates a heightened awareness of issues of race, class, and gender. Boime favored social interpretations of art history, and many of the materials in this series relate to his 6-volume Social History of Modern Art series. The majority of research topics listed in this series also correspond to publications, articles, books, and lectures produced by Boime. This series is arranged by subject into 52 subseries, which are ordered by volume of material. Box 150 includes 3 CDs containing television interviews on medical issues. These interviews may be in Farsi.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_fa781b53ef8df0f933f3786d1154afba"><head>Arrangment</head><p>Series is divided into 52 subseries grouped by subject.</p></arrangement><phystech id="aspace_38d19808deab2edfc7963d4a28cb11e5"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>SERIES CONTAINS DIGITAL MATERIALS: Special equipment or further processing may be required for viewing.

Within these topics Boime collected a range of material including basic information about each monument as well as examples of this iconography or imagery being repurposed for other purposes. The file is arranged by type of material beginning with publication drafts and associated correspondence, and ending with research files.

A significant portion of material corresponds to astronomical phenomena. This body of work is likely related to Boime's argument that Van Gogh's painting "Starry Night" reflected actual astronomical events rather than the imaginary musings of a madman. The subseries also includes comparative research on Van Gogh and Thomas Nast for several publications. Materials include correspondence and information from the Voyager company about an educational Van Gogh CD-ROM for which Boime was a consultant.
