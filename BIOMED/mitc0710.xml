    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>A manuscript record of physician G. (Geo.) Alfred Mitchell's practice in Michaelsville [Maryland?], commencing 1 April 1853 and running through 1 November 1856. Brief records were added in December of that year, then crossed-out. Entries, occupying 235 of 383 pages, were kept in a neat hand in a pre-bound, lined ledger titled "Day book", with pre-numbered pages; the ledger has a printed label for "Joseph Hutt, Stationer, blank book manufacturer, engraver and printer" on Chestnut St. in Philadelphia. All recorded visits are in Michaelsville or "Michaels ville". Entries are kept chronologically, kept almost exclusively by the name of the male head of household, followed by "to visit to" and "self" or "wife" or the name of a family member examined or treated, followed by a procedure or treatment. Some entries may be for hired help or slaves; some visits are identified as "boy" or "child" instead of a name, and others include "to services for man Phil" (p.116) and "for services to man[servant?]" (p.118). Named treatments include wound dressing, venesection, cupping, vaccination, whooping cough, and tooth extraction. In March 1855, a line is added to each entry for medicines prescribed or sold (powder, opium, acid drops, etc.), and charges are itemized for services vs. prescriptions. On 27 February, 1858, in a witnessed statement written on page 237, Mitchell transfered his practice, comprising "all moneys and accounts mentioned, specified or contained in this book", to Bernard Mitchell.</p>  </scopecontent>
