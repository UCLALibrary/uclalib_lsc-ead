    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The manuscript ledger of Dr. Charles Lancaster (1808-1903), a physician, lawyer, and author in Newark, New Jersey, documents his recipes for and trade in medical remedies, and as an "electro-medical specialist". The ledger begins with a "list of medicines in Nathan Harper's Box", alongside recipes for "Electric Fluid", "for suppression of menses", and "for Rheumatism". This is followed by lists of purchases: "Account of Stock, September 1st, 1855" (books); "Stationery", and "Draining and painting materials". Beginning September 1855, Lancaster begins a long record of purchases and charges for services rendered (visits and examinations, syringes, compresses, etc.), then the sale of medical remedies including Keswick's cough syrup, Queen liniment, Catarrh Remedy, and rheumatism medicine. A printed advertisement, laid in, identifies "Catarrh Remedy" and "Prescription for the Blood" as two of the "Lancaster Remedies" prepared solely by him, for sale at the principal showroom in Newark and his residence in East Orange. Patients hailing from throughout New Jersey, as well as Staten Island and Pennsylvania, are identified by name throughout the journal. Lancaster's biggest seller for a number of years is "Vital Tonic", often abbreviated "V.T.", presumably from a formula of his own making; Vital Tonic also is sold in large quantities to numerous buyers, including some pharmacists. His own purchases include multiple entries for ammonia and sulfuric acid--presumably for use in the preparation of remedies--as well as some items for personal and household consumption. Battery-related entries appear more regularly as the journal progresses. A handwritten slip, partially cut-away, appears to be the draft of a handbill or advertisement promoting himself as an "Electro-Medical Specialist" and offering his services to treat insanity "(the patient being in condition to receive my treatment), free of charge, till cured." The latter part of the journal includes entries for inserting advertisements in local New Jersey publications such as the "Newark Journal" and "Elizabeth Journal". Also present are dealings with the William M. Townley Drug Co. of Newark; McKesson and Robbins; and hospitals.</p>  </scopecontent>
