    <abstract id="aspace_6d52e8df6c01f751d76f06bda8d2e43d" label="Abstract">Contains 22 sheets of light blue lined paper and 2 thick sheets of cream paper, upon which are mounted the 2 plates. The volume has been set up to resemble a published book--even though it is handwritten--replete with a mock title page (title, place, date, surrounded by a border), blank t.p. verso, dedication page (with blank verso), text (divided by chapter headings) extending to the recto of the last blue sheet, finally, the verso of the last sheet describes the figures found on the following plates. The ruled paper shows evidence of having been folded in half, and there is a large manila envelope (which could have accommodated the folded ms.) mounted on a binding sheet in front. The address area of the envelope has been mostly obliterated by a piece of paper pasted over it, which reads: Original de la Memoria sobre el Maguii mexicano por D. Pedro Blasquez. There is an official stamp on the envelope: Imperio Mexicano - Secretaria de Estado y Negocios. This ms., therefore, was probably made as a presentation copy for Maximilian and Carlotta.</abstract>
