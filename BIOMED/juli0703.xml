    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>"This the office account book for Dr. John M. Julian, who maintained an office at 165 Washington Street in Hoboken and practiced medicine in that city for many years (cf. Gopsill's 1866 Jersey City and Hoboken Directory). Holograph volume chronicles patient visits to Dr. Julian's office from 1869-1872, listing patient names, dates, and amounts they paid. A number of entries also include medical treatments and services provided such as 'setting arm and collar bone', 'dressing head', 'examination', 'consultation', 'call and splint', 'to operation', 'vaccination', 'visit and medicine', 'bound to confinement', 'deliver placenta', 'cured', 'visit and splint', 'advise sick', 'removed fish hook', 'cupping and visit', 'died at 7pm---taken sick at 1pm', 'open abscess', etc. He also appears to occasionally treat patients with an electrical current of some type. Many patients here were seen multiple times and their residential addresses often accompany entries for services provided and payments made. The term 'poor' is attached to some patient names, suggesting they were unable to pay their full bill. Other entries include weather observations such as 'hottest day on record', 'very stormy', etc., while some are more detailed. Such is the case for patient [EA] who 'got carried off the steamer by mistake and went to Stonington [Connecticut]' or a patient with the last name of [F]: 'woman having convulsions delivered without waiting for labor--and convulsions cease--child breathed after delivery but--could not maintain respir[ations] mother very low--pulse before labor 154 after 100'. While a few patients resided in nearby cities such as Jersey City and Newark, the vast majority of patients treated lived in Hoboken and West Hoboken. Notations indicate he also treated numerous Hoboken police officers along with city officials. ... In addition, he made various payments to nurses who presumably worked for him at his office."</p><p>Source: Antiquarian bookseller's description, 2016.</p>  </scopecontent>
