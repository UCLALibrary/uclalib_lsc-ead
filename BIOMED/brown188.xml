    <abstract id="aspace_f6d3b7bc05cd3da14776d18e46c018be" label="Abstract">Orville Harry Brown was born in Kansas July 18, 1875 and died in So. California on July 25, 1943. In 1905 he received both a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago and an M.D. from St. Louis University. At various times Dr. Brown taught at the university level, served as Physician-in-Chief and then Superintendent of the Missouri State Sanatorium for the Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis, and as Arizona State Superintendent of Public Health and Secretary of the State Board of Health. He was the editor of "Southwestern Medicine" for many years, and authored two books. These papers deal exclusively with Dr. Brown's professional life, consisting mainly of reprints and a few formal reports. They also contain many (crumbling) newspaper clippings on the Spanish American War, President McKinley, and considerable material on the Committee of One Hundred for National Health (an offshoot of the American Association for the Advancement of Science) and the Committee's supporting group, the American Health League.</abstract>

    <head>Biography</head>
<p>Orville Harry Brown was born in Sabetha, Kansas, on July 18, 1875 and died in Arcadia, California on July 25, 1943. He attended Ottawa (KS) University, received an AB degree from the University of Kansas in 1901, and in 1905 a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago and the M.D. degree from St. Louis University. He did graduate work at the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole during two summers, and post-graduate studies in Vienna and London during 1906.</p><p>At various times Dr. Brown taught physiology, pharmacology, and medicine at the University of Kansas, the University of Chicago, and St. Louis University. From 1907 to 1909 Dr. Brown served as Physician-in-Chief and then Superintendent of the Missouri State Sanatorium for the Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis, Mount Vernon, MO. In 1918 he was State Superintendent of Public Health in Arizona, and Secretary of its State Board of Health. For many years Dr. Brown was the editor of "Southwestern Medicine". In addition to numerous articles he wrote two books, "Laboratory Physiology" (1905), and "Asthma" (1916).</p><p>Dr. Brown was a Fellow of the American Medical Association, the American College of Physicians, and the Royal Society of Medicine, London, and he held memberships in the American College of Chest Physicians and the American Association of Biological Chemists. He was certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine. He was married, and had one daughter.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>The papers deal exclusively with Dr. Brown's professional life, but cover that in only very partial fashion. There are reprints of articles and a very few of the administrative reports he submitted to Missouri and Arizona institutions. There is nothing about his academic life nor, apart from published case reports, about his activities as a clinical physician. There is no correspondence or other documentation of his interactions with colleagues.</p><p>The mass of newspaper clippings reveal Dr. Brown's interest in the Spanish American War, especially focused on the policies of President McKinley. There is also considerable material dealing with the Committee of One Hundred for National Health, an offshoot of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the Committee's supporting group, the American Health League. It is not clear what relationship Dr. Brown held with these groups, but he was possibly a member of the American Health League and was interested in its goals.</p><p>The collection is organized into the following series: <list><item>Series 1. Writings by OHB, 1904-1940. 3 folders</item><item>Series 2. Miscellaneous Materials, 1886-1908. 16 folders</item></list></p>  </scopecontent>
