    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>E.A. Knorr, M.D., was a surgeon at Presbyterian Eye, ear and Throat Hospital in Baltimore. He also had an appointment as Associate in Ophthalmology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and College of Physicians and Surrgeons. "A 1914 news report indicates that Dr. Knorr had removed three pieces of skin from the left arm of Mrs. Sarah Trego, 50, and made a new lid for her left eye. Dr. Knorr contributed articles to the American Journal of Ophthalmology during the 1920's, including a running monologue as to the complications that arose during one hundred consecutive cataract surgeries, 'with the results obtained and details regarding a particularly difficult case in which good vision was obtained in spite of lack of cooperation on the part of the patient' (Vol. 6, February, 1923).</p><p>Source: Antiquarian bookseller's description, 2015.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Four volumes of manuscript patient case notes, with handwritten indexes referring to page numbers bearing patient records, document the practice of E.A. Knorr, M.D., an ophthalmologist practicing and teaching in Baltimore, Maryland, from 1905 to 1948. Several non-ophthalmologic cases are described beginning in 1905. Ophthalmologic cases begin in 1908 and range through 1925 in handwritten ledger entires; follow-up visits, tests, and correspondence continue into 1948 on notes, forms, and charts which are laid-in adjacent to earlier notes for a particular patient. case notes include names, addresses, ages, symptoms, and treatments. Visual field maps are completed on standard forms (printed first in German, then in English) and are clipped- or laid-in. Numerous original, hand-drawn illustrations of eye disorders, many in color, are scattered throughout the ledgers. Patients chiefly originated from Baltimore, Maryland and surrounding communities; some cases bear home addresses in Pennsylvania or New York.</p>  </scopecontent>
