    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The manikin was designed as a practical obstetrical teaching tool for the training of midwives. The skull is attached to the torso of the manikin with a round, metal eye-hook and fabric tape which allows for full range of motion. In addition to the facial features and anatomically correct suture lines of the skull, the body of the manikin has a rib cage and vertebral column formed by placing a variety of sizes of cords under the leather covering. Clavicles, scapulas, tibias, ilium and iliac crests are indicated by the use of additional, leather (?) inserts under the leather "skin" covering the manikin. Small nipples are also palpable. Individual fingers and toes have been created by stitching. A short umbilical cord is present on the abdomen.</p><p>The accompanying documents include: the docketed, printed minutes of the "General County Meeting of the Members of the Associated Apothecaries and Surgeon-Apothecaries of England and Wales...Held at Stafford...on Thursday the 21st day of October 1819" ; a certificate from the "Theatre London Hospital" attesting that "Mr. Chr. John Greatrex has diligently attended two courses of my Lectures on the Principles and Practice of Surgery." The certificate is dated and signed "May 5th 1814, Richard Climent Headington" ; a certificate signed and dated by "Richard Dennison, M.D. F.R.S London Hospital Jany. 1814," attesting that "Mr. John Greatrex diligently attended my lectures on the Theory and Practice of Midwifery, &amp; the Diseases of Women &amp; Children; &amp; that he attended in various cases of labors..." ; an unsigned letter postmarked 13 April 1814, addressed to "Mr. Christopher Greatrex at the London Hospital, Whitechapel Road, London," expressing regrets "I am sorry to say my health has continued indifferent since I saw you on which account I have relinquished my practice for the present..." ; an autographed letter signed, dated April 11, 1814, Harrogate, Yorkshire to Christopher Greatrex certifying that he "served a regular apprenticeship of five years with me whereby he had an opportunity of being initiated in the practice of Surgery &amp; Pharmacy." The letter is signed "Chas. Salt (?)."</p>  </scopecontent>
