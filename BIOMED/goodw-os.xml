Twenty original letters from William Osler, M.D. to Howard Atwood Kelly, M.D., dated 1897-1917, plus the notes and materials Dr. Goodwin used to write an article for the "Bulletin of the History of Medicine" (20(5): 611-652, Dec. 1946) on the relationship between Osler and Kelly and correspondence pertaining to that article before and after its publication. 2. Transcriptions of many letters from Osler to Henry Barton Jacobs, M.D., dated 1893-1919, and extensive notes made by Dr. Goodwin who probably intended to publish an article based upon this correspondence.</abstract>

    <head>Biography</head>
<p>Sir William Osler, 1st Baronet (1849–1919) has been called the Father of Modern Medicine and his influence on medical education and practice is still huge. He was a person of great charm, energy, and wide intellectual interests, who excelled as physician, teacher, bibliophile, and author. Canadian born, he received an M.D. from McGill University, Montreal, and taught there for 10 years. His career continued as Chair of Clinical Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, then first Chief of Staff at Johns Hopkins Hospital and Professor of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and finally Regius Chair of Medicine at Oxford University. Throughout his life Osler was known to write a large number of notes and letters to his wide circle of friends and acquaintances.</p><p>The distinguished American gynecologist Howard Atwood Kelly (1858–1943) received his M.D. from the University of Pennsylvania, where he also taught for a number of years and came to know William Osler. The two were rejoined when Kelly was appointed professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University. They made up half of "The Four Doctors" who founded Johns Hopkins Hospital and are depicted in a famous group portrait by John Singer Sargent. The pair also shared an interest in medical history and a strong love of book collecting. Kelly's interest also extended to natural history; he was a herpetologist of some renown.</p><p>Henry Barton Jacobs (1858-1939) received his A.B. and M.D. degrees from Harvard University. Within a year of his medical school graduation he moved to Baltimore to become the private physician for Robert Garrett, president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. In 1889 he joined the dispensary service of the newly-opened Johns Hopkins Hospital, under physician-in-chief William Osler. Later he also taught classes in physical diagnosis and therapeutics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Dr. Jacobs was especially interested in combating tuberculosis and he took an active role in anti-TB campaigns; for many years he served as secretary of the National Tuberculosis Association. Jacobs was not only a physician serving under Osler's guidance; the two became friends through their shared interest in medical history and collecting of books, and they were close physical neighbors on Franklin Street in Baltimore.</p>  </bioghist>
