    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection consists of a photograph album containing 10 images of the staff, patients, and buildings of the Binnengasthuis hospital in Amsterdam, bound for presentation "Aan mejuffrouw G.B. Cort v.d. Linden. 1 juli 1886 - 1895 31 maart" (title from spine), with a title page calligraphed by Antonie Grevenstuck, 1895. The album presumably was a parting gift given to Ms G. B. Cort van der Linden, "Adjunct-Directr[ice]". The interior and exterior photographs include views of the children's, women's and men's wards, and provide insight into life at one of the oldest and leading hospitals in Amsterdam, the Binnengasthuis, at the end of the nineteenth century. A contemporary journal suggests that Ms Cort van der Linden was forced to leave due to health reasons.</p><p>"The Binnengasthuis was one of a number of religious houses converted into hospitals at the end of the 16th century, and served primarily the poor, soldiers, sailors and travelers. By the mid 19th century it had a notorious reputation for deplorable conditions, but under the leadership of Henry Arnold Zegers, appointed in 1882, presumably with the assistance of Ms Cort van der Linden, the hospital underwent significant changes and improvements in both of the care of patients, and the condition of the buildings, gaining a reputation as a superbly appointed medical clinic."--Antiquarian bookseller's description.</p>  </scopecontent>
