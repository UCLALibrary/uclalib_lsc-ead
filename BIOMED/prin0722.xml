    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Collection of 317 original printed bottle, box, and pill box labels, on 30 leaves, from an unknown printer. Includes 215 labels mounted on scrapbook leaves and 122 tipped on, usually with a "fan" arrangement, so one can see all of the variants of a particular design. Covers a wide range of products: pills for many different ailments as well as syrups and elixirs of all sorts. Many incorporate art nouveau designs, and often with added silver or gold gilt. Most of the labels also incorporate an American eagle design--one that was commonly used in French advertising material to indicate "English spoken here" for English-speaking visitors; but in this case perhaps to suggest sale or use in the American market, or to suggest to an American visitor in a French pharmacy that this was a bona fide safe product. The album binding is stamped "G.G. on the front cover.</p>  </scopecontent>
