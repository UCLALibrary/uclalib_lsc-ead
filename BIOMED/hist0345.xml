    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Collection consists of a typescript copy of outline and notes to accompany a college course on the history of entomology, presumably at University of California, Berkeley. "The first half of the course, that dealing with the history as pertaining to the Old World, will be given by Prof. [Edwin Cooper] Van Dyke [(1869-1952)], and that dealing with it in the New World especially the United States, by Prof. [Edward Oliver] Essig [(1884-1964)]. The approximate date of production, not later than 1931, is based on the latest bibliograophic reference in the text. Handwritten annotations on the later leaves may be by the donor of the volume, Robert M. Fouts, wasp entomologist at the Smithsonian Institution.</p><p>We are committed to providing ethical, inclusive, and anti-racist description of the materials we steward, and to remediating existing description of our materials that contains language
