The Program is coordinated by the National Library of Medicine and carried out through a nationwide network of health science libraries and information centers. The UCLA Louise M. Darling Biomedical Library is the Regional Medical Library (RML) for the National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NN/LM), Pacific Southwest Region. The Pacific Southwest Region includes the states of Arizona, California, Hawaii, and Nevada, and the U.S.-Associated Pacific Basin (the six island jurisdictions of American Samoa, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Republic of Palau, as well as the Armed Forces Pacific). The NN/LM-PSR was first known as the Pacific Southwest Regional Medical Library Service (PSRML).</p>  </scopecontent>
