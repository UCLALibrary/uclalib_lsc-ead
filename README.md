# UCLA Library Special Collections Finding Aid Files
At [UCLA Library Special Collections](https://www.library.ucla.edu/location/library-special-collections), we acquire, preserve, promote, and make accessible a world-class collection of archives, rare books, manuscripts, photographs, and other rare and unique materials that tell the story of our collective past. Our holdings document society and culture from the ancient to the contemporary and we hold a great appreciation for a sophisticated understanding of history in its broadest sense.
